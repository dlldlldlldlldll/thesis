  Numerical assessments of global air quality and potential changes in
  atmospheric chemical constituents require estimates of the surface fluxes of
  a variety of trace gas species. We have developed a global model to estimate
  emissions of volatile organic compounds from natural sources (NVOC). Methane
  is not considered here and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere. The model
  has a highly resolved spatial grid (0.5° × 0.5° latitude/longitude) and
  generates hourly average emission estimates. Chemical species are grouped
  into four categories: isoprene, monoterpenes, other reactive VOC (ORVOC), and
  other VOC (OVOC). NVOC emissions from oceans are estimated as a function of
  geophysical variables from a general circulation model and ocean color
  satellite data. Emissions from plant foliage are estimated from ecosystem
  specific biomass and emission factors and algorithms describing light and
  temperature dependence of NVOC emissions. Foliar density estimates are based
  on climatic variables and satellite data. Temporal variations in the model
  are driven by monthly estimates of biomass and temperature and hourly light
  estimates. The annual global VOC flux is estimated to be 1150 Tg C, composed
  of 44% isoprene, 11% monoterpenes, 22.5% other reactive VOC, and 22.5% other
  VOC. Large uncertainties exist for each of these estimates and particularly
  for compounds other than isoprene and monoterpenes. Tropical woodlands (rain
  forest, seasonal, drought-deciduous, and savanna) contribute about half of
  all global natural VOC emissions. Croplands, shrublands and other woodlands
  contribute 10–20% apiece. Isoprene emissions calculated for temperate
  regions are as much as a factor of 5 higher than previous estimates.%

  The present status of knowledge of the gas-phase reactions of inorganic O(x),
  HO(x) and NO(x) species and of selected classes of volatile organic compounds
  (VOCs) [alkanes, alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, oxygen-containing VOCs and
  nitrogen-containing VOCs] and their degradation products in the troposphere
  is discussed. There is now a good qualitative and, in a number of areas,
  quantitative understanding of the tropospheric chemistry of NO(x) and VOCs
  involved in the photochemical formation of ozone. During the past five years
  much progress has been made in elucidating the reactions of alkoxy radicals,
  the mechanisms of the gas-phase reactions of O3 with alkenes, and the
  mechanisms and products of the OH radical-initiated reactions of aromatic
  hydrocarbons, and further progress is expected. However, there are still
  areas of uncertainty which impact the ability to accurately model the
  formation of ozone in urban, rural and regional areas, and these include a
  need for: rate constants and mechanisms of the reactions of organic peroxy
  (RO2) radicals with NO, NO3 radicals, HO2 radicals and other RO2 radicals;
  organic nitrate yields from the reactions of RO2 radicals with NO, preferably
  as a function of temperature and pressure; the reaction rates of alkoxy
  radicals for decomposition, isomerization, and reaction with O2, especially
  for alkoxy radicals other than those formed from alkanes and alkenes; the
  detailed mechanisms of the reactions of O3 with alkenes and VOCs containing
  >C=C< bonds; the mechanisms and products of the reactions of OH-aromatic
  adducts with O2 and NO2; the tropospheric chemistry of many oxygenated VOCs
  formed as first-generation products of VOC photooxidations; and a
  quantitative understanding of the reaction sequences leading to products
  which gas/particle partition and lead to secondary organic aerosol
  formation.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The terrestrial biosphere has experienced dramatic changes in recent decades.
  Estimates of historical trends in land carbon fluxes remain uncertain because
  long-term observations are limited on the global scale. Here, we use the Yale
  Interactive terrestrial Biosphere (YIBs) model to estimate decadal trends in
  land carbon fluxes and emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds
  (BVOCs) and to identify the key drivers for these changes during 1982-2011.
  Driven by hourly meteorology from WFDEI (WATCH forcing data methodology
  applied to ERA-Interim data), the model simulates an increasing trend of 297
  Tg Ca-2 in gross primary productivity (GPP) and 185 Tg Ca-2 in the net
  primary productivity (NPP). CO2 fertilization is the main driver for the flux
  changes in forest ecosystems, while meteorology dominates the changes in
  grasslands and shrublands. Warming boosts summer GPP and NPP at high
  latitudes, while drought dampens carbon uptake in tropical regions. North of
  30 degrees N, increasing temperatures induce a substantial extension of 0.22
  day a(-1) for the growing season; however, this phenological change alone
  does not promote regional carbon uptake and BVOC emissions. Nevertheless,
  increases of leaf area index at peak season accounts for similar to 25% of
  the trends in GPP and isoprene emissions at the northern lands. The net land
  sink shows statistically insignificant increases of only 3 Tg Ca-2 globally
  because of simultaneous increases in soil respiration. Global BVOC emissions
  are calculated using two schemes. With the photosynthesis-dependent scheme,
  the model predicts increases of 0.4 Tg Ca-2 in isoprene emissions, which are
  mainly attributed to warming trends because CO2 fertilization and inhibition
  effects offset each other. Using the MEGAN (Model of Emissions of Gases and
  Aerosols from Nature) scheme, the YIBs model simulates global reductions of
  1.1 Tg Ca-2 in isoprene and 0.04 Tg Ca-2 in monoterpene emissions in response
  to the CO2 inhibition effects. Land use change shows limited impacts on
  global carbon fluxes and BVOC emissions, but there are regional contrasting
  impacts over Europe (afforestation) and China (deforestation).%

  As an ubiquitous product of the oxidation of many volatile organic compounds
  (VOCs), formaldehyde (HCHO) plays a key role as a short-lived and reactive
  intermediate in the atmospheric photo-oxidation pathways leading to the
  formation of tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosols. In this
  study, HCHO profiles have been successfully retrieved from ground-based
  Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) solar spectra and UV-visible Multi-AXis
  Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) scans recorded during
  the July 2010-December 2012 time period at the Jungfraujoch station (Swiss
  Alps, 46.5 degrees N, 8.0 degrees E, 3580 ma.s.l.). Analysis of the retrieved
  products has revealed different vertical sensitivity between both remote
  sensing techniques. Furthermore, HCHO amounts simulated by two
  state-of-the-art chemical transport models (CTMs), GEOS-Chem and IMAGES v2,
  have been compared to FTIR total columns and MAX-DOAS 3.6-8 km partial
  columns, accounting for the respective vertical resolution of each
  ground-based instrument. Using the CTM outputs as the intermediate, FTIR and
  MAX-DOAS retrievals have shown consistent seasonal modulations of HCHO
  throughout the investigated period, characterized by summertime maximum and
  wintertime minimum. Such comparisons have also highlighted that FTIR and
  MAX-DOAS provide complementary products for the HCHO retrieval above the
  Jungfraujoch station. Finally, tests have revealed that the updated IR
  parameters from the HITRAN 2012 database have a cumulative effect and
  significantly decrease the retrieved HCHO columns with respect to the use of
  the HITRAN 2008 compilation.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  We conducted an extended follow-up and spatial analysis of the American
  Cancer Society (ACS) Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II) cohort in order to
  further examine associations between long-term exposure to particulate air
  pollution and mortality in large U.S. cities. The current study sought to
  clarify outstanding scientific issues that arose from our earlier
  HEI-sponsored Reanalysis of the original ACS study data (the Particle
  Epidemiology Reanalysis Project). Specifically, we examined (1) how ecologic
  covariates at the community and neighborhood levels might confound and modify
  the air pollution-mortality association; (2) how spatial autocorrelation and
  multiple levels of data (e.g., individual and neighborhood) can be taken into
  account within the random effects Cox model; (3) how using land-use
  regression to refine measurements of air pollution exposure to the
  within-city (or intra-urban) scale might affect the size and significance of
  health effects in the Los Angeles and New York City regions; and (4) what
  exposure time windows may be most critical to the air pollution-mortality
  association. The 18 years of follow-up (extended from 7 years in the original
  study [Pope et al. 1995]) included vital status data for the CPS-II cohort
  (approximately 1.2 million participants) with multiple cause-of-death codes
  through December 31, 2000 and more recent exposure data from air pollution
  monitoring sites for the metropolitan areas. In the Nationwide Analysis, the
  influence of ecologic covariate data (such as education attainment, housing
  characteristics, and level of income; data obtained from the 1980 U.S.
  Census; see Ecologic Covariates sidebar on page 14) on the air
  pollution-mortality association were examined at the Zip Code area (ZCA)
  scale, the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) scale, and by the difference
  between each ZCA value and the MSA value (DIFF). In contrast to previous
  analyses that did not directly include ecologic covariates at the ZCA scale,
  risk estimates increased when ecologic covariates were included at all
  scales. The ecologic covariates exerted their greatest effect on mortality
  from ischemic heart disease (IHD), which was also the health outcome most
  strongly related with exposure to PM2.5 (particles 2.5 microm or smaller in
  aerodynamic diameter), sulfate (SO4(2-)), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), and the
  only outcome significantly associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide
  (NO2). When ecologic covariates were simultaneously included at both the MSA
  and DIFF levels, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality from IHD associated with
  PM2.5 exposure (average concentration for 1999-2000) increased by 7.5% and
  that associated with SO4(2-) exposure (average concentration for 1990)
  increased by 12.8%. The two covariates found to exert the greatest
  confounding influence on the PM2.5-mortality association were the percentage
  of the population with a grade 12 education and the median household income.
  Also in the Nationwide Analysis, complex spatial patterns in the CPS-II data
  were explored with an extended random effects Cox model (see Glossary of
  Statistical Terms at end of report) that is capable of clustering up to two
  geographic levels of data. Using this model tended to increase the HR
  estimate for exposure to air pollution and also to inflate the uncertainty in
  the estimates. Including ecologic covariates decreased the variance of the
  results at both the MSA and ZCA scales; the largest decrease was in residual
  variation based on models in which the MSA and DIFF levels of data were
  included together, which suggests that partitioning the ecologic covariates
  into between-MSA and within-MSA values more completely captures the sources
  of variation in the relationship between air pollution, ecologic covariates,
  and mortality. Intra-Urban Analyses were conducted for the New York City and
  Los Angeles regions. The results of the Los Angeles spatial analysis, where
  we found high exposure contrasts within the Los Angeles region, showed that
  air pollution-mortality risks were nearly 3 times greater than those reported
  from earlier analyses. This suggests that chronic health effects associated
  with intra-urban gradients in exposure to PM2.5 may be even larger between
  ZCAs within an MSA than the associations between MSAs that have been
  previously reported. However, in the New York City spatial analysis, where we
  found very little exposure contrast between ZCAs within the New York region,
  mortality from all causes, cardiopulmonary disease (CPD), and lung cancer was
  not elevated. A positive association was seen for PM2.5 exposure and IHD,
  which provides evidence of a specific association with a cause of death that
  has high biologic plausibility. These results were robust when analyses
  controlled (1) the 44 individual-level covariates (from the ACS enrollment
  questionnaire in 1982; see 44 Individual-Level Covariates sidebar on page 22)
  and (2) spatial clustering using the random effects Cox model. Effects were
  mildly lower when unemployment at the ZCA scale was included. To examine
  whether there is a critical exposure time window that is primarily
  responsible for the increased mortality associated with ambient air
  pollution, we constructed individual time-dependent exposure profiles for
  particulate and gaseous air pollutants (PM2.5 and SO2) for a subset of the
  ACS CPS-II participants for whom residence histories were available. The
  relevance of the three exposure time windows we considered was gauged using
  the magnitude of the relative risk (HR) of mortality as well as the Akaike
  information criterion (AIC), which measures the goodness of fit of the model
  to the data. For PM2.5, no one exposure time window stood out as
  demonstrating the greatest HR; nor was there any clear pattern of a trend in
  HR going from recent to more distant windows or vice versa. Differences in
  AIC values among the three exposure time windows were also small. The HRs for
  mortality associated with exposure to SO2 were highest in the most recent
  time window (1 to 5 years), although none of these HRs were significantly
  elevated. Identifying critical exposure time windows remains a challenge that
  warrants further work with other relevant data sets. This study provides
  additional support toward developing cost-effective air quality management
  policies and strategies. The epidemiologic results reported here are
  consistent with those from other population-based studies, which collectively
  have strongly supported the hypothesis that long-term exposure to PM2.5
  increases mortality in the general population. Future research using the
  extended Cox-Poisson random effects methods, advanced geostatistical modeling
  techniques, and newer exposure assessment techniques will provide additional
  insight.%

  Formaldehyde (HCHO) columns have been retrieved from ground-based Fourier
  transform infrared (FTIR) campaign measurements in 2004 and 2007 and from
  UV-Visible MAX-DOAS measurements in 2004-2005 at the NDACC site of R,union
  Island (21 degrees S, 55 degrees E). The FTIR and MAX-DOAS daily mean
  formaldehyde total columns are intercompared in their common measurement
  period, from August to October 2004. The ground-based data are also compared
  to correlative SCIAMACHY data. The comparisons account for the vertical
  sensitivity differences of the data sets, by including their respective
  averaging kernels. Complete error budgets are also presented. The FTIR and
  MAX-DOAS daily mean total columns agree very well: no significant bias is
  observed and the standard deviation of the comparisons is only 8%. Both FTIR
  and MAX-DOAS HCHO total columns are in good agreement with SCIAMACHY values
  in the 2004-2005 period, with standard deviations of 21% and 31%,
  respectively. The same seasonal cycle is observed by the different
  instruments, with a minimum in austral winter and a maximum in
  February-March. The FTIR and MAX-DOAS data are confronted with HCHO columns
  calculated by a global CTM, the IMAGES model. The model underestimates the
  HCHO columns by 23-29% in comparison with FTIR, and by 15% in comparison with
  DOAS. This bias might have multiple causes, including an underestimation of
  OH concentrations in the model (as indicated by a sensitivity study using
  prescribed OH fields) and/or an underestimated contribution of large-scale
  transport of HCHO precursors from Madagascar. The latter hypothesis is
  comforted by the large observed day-to-day variability of HCHO columns, and
  by the observation that the peak values of FTIR columns can often be
  associated with free tropospheric transport patterns from source regions over
  Madagascar to R,union Island, according to simulations performed with the
  Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART.%

  We present and discuss the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO)
  formaldehyde (H2CO) retrieval algorithm for the Ozone Monitoring Instrument
  (OMI) which is the operational retrieval for NASA OMI H2CO. The version of
  the algorithm described here includes relevant changes with respect to the
  operational one, including differences in the reference spectra for H2CO, the
  fit of O2–O2 collisional complex, updates in the high-resolution solar
  reference spectrum, the use of a model reference sector over the remote
  Pacific Ocean to normalize the retrievals, an updated air mass factor (AMF)
  calculation scheme, and the inclusion of scattering weights and vertical H2CO
  profile in the level 2 products. The setup of the retrieval is discussed in
  detail. We compare the results of the updated retrieval with the results from
  the previous SAO H2CO retrieval. The improvement in the slant column fit
  increases the temporal stability of the retrieval and slightly reduces the
  noise. The change in the AMF calculation has increased the AMFs by 20%,
  mainly due to the consideration of the radiative cloud fraction. Typical
  values for retrieved vertical columns are between 4 × 1015 and 4 × 1016
  molecules cm−2, with typical fitting uncertainties ranging between 45 and
  100%. In high-concentration regions the errors are usually reduced to 30%.
  The detection limit is estimated at 1 × 1016 molecules cm−2.%

  On the basis of a data set collected during the Indian Ocean Experiment
  (INDOEX) campaign 1999, we investigated the formaldehyde (CH2O) budget in the
  southern Indian Ocean (SIO). With a photochemical box model we simulated the
  contribution of methane and nonmethane volatile organic compounds to the CH2O
  budget. To identify the reactions and model constraints that introduce the
  largest uncertainties in the modeled CH2O concentration, we carried out a
  local sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo method was used to
  assess the global error of the model predictions. According to this analysis
  the 2 uncertainty in the modeled CH2O concentration is 49%. The deviation
  between observed (200 +/- 70 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) (2sigma))
  and modeled (224 +/- 110 pptv (2sigma)) daily mean CH2O concentration is 12%.
  However, the combined errors of model and measurement are such that
  deviations as large as 65% are not significant at the 2 level. Beyond the
  "standard'' photochemistry we analyzed the impact of halogen and aerosol
  chemistry on the CH2O concentration and investigated the vertical
  distribution of CH2O in the marine boundary layer (MBL). Calculations with
  the Model of Chemistry Considering Aerosols indicate that, based on the
  current understanding, halogen chemistry and aerosol chemistry have no
  significant impact on the CH2O concentration under conditions encountered in
  the SIO. However, a detailed investigation including meteorological effects
  such as precipitation scavenging and convection reveals an uncertainty in
  state-of- the-art model predictions for CH2O in the MBL that is too large for
  a meaningful test of the current understanding of CH4 photooxidation.%

  We present a largely tutorial overview of the main processes that influence
  the photochemistry of the background troposphere. This is mostly driven by
  the photolysis of ozone by solar ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter
  than about 340 nm, resulting in production of excited O(1D) atoms, whose
  reaction with water vapor produces OH radicals. In the background atmosphere
  the OH radicals mostly react with CO, and with CH4 and some of its oxidation
  products, which in turn are oxidized by OH. Depending on the availability of
  NOx catalysts, ozone may be produced or destroyed in amounts that are much
  greater than the downward flux of ozone from the stratosphere to the
  troposphere. Using the 3D chemical-transport model MATCH, global
  distributions and budget analyses are presented for tropospheric O3, CH4, CO,
  and the “odd hydrogen” compounds OH, HO2 and H2O2. We show that OH is
  present in maximum concentrations in the tropics, and that most of the
  chemical breakdown of CO and CH4 also occurs in equatorial regions. We also
  split the troposphere into continental and marine regions, and show that
  there is a tremendous difference in photochemical O3 and OH production for
  these regions, much larger than the difference between the northern
  hemisphere and southern hemisphere. Finally, we show the results from a
  numerical simulation in which we reduced the amount of ozone in the model
  stratosphere by a factor of 10 (which in turn reduced the flux of O3 into the
  troposphere by about the same factor). Nevertheless, for summer conditions,
  model calculated O3 mixing ratios below 5 km in the mid to high latitudes
  were about 70–90% as high as those calculated with the full downward flux
  of ozone from the stratosphere. This indicates that, at least under these
  conditions, O3 concentrations in the lower troposphere are largely controlled
  by in situ photochemistry, with only a secondary influence from stratospheric
  influx.%

  For the first time, carbon monoxide (CO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) satellite
  retrievals are used together with methane (CH4) and methyl choloroform
  (CH3CCl3 or MCF) surface measurements in an advanced inversion system. The CO
  and HCHO are respectively from the MOPITT and OMI instruments. The
  multi-species and multi-satellite dataset inversion is done for the
  2005–2010 period. The robustness of our results is evaluated by comparing
  our posterior-modeled concentrations with several sets of independent
  measurements of atmospheric mixing ratios. The inversion leads to significant
  changes from the prior to the posterior, in terms of magnitude and
  seasonality of the CO and CH4 surface fluxes and of the HCHO production by
  non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). The latter is significantly
  decreased, indicating an overestimation of the biogenic NMVOC emissions, such
  as isoprene, in the GEIA inventory. CO and CH4 surface emissions are
  increased by the inversion, from 1037 to 1394 TgCO and from 489 to 529 TgCH4
  on average for the 2005–2010 period. CH4 emissions present significant
  interannual variability and a joint CO-CH4 fluxes analysis reveals that
  tropical biomass burning probably played a role in the recent increase of
  atmospheric methane.%

  Formaldehyde (HCHO) column data from satellites are widely used as a proxy
  for emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but validation of the
  data has been extremely limited. Here we use highly accurate HCHO aircraft
  observations from the NASA SEAC4RS campaign over the Southeast US in
  August-September 2013 to validate and intercompare six operational and
  research retrievals of HCHO columns from four different satellite instruments
  (OMI, GOME2A, GOME2B and OMPS) and three different research groups. The
  GEOS-Chem chemical transport model provides a common intercomparison
  platform. We find that all retrievals capture the HCHO maximum over Arkansas
  and Louisiana, reflecting high emissions of biogenic isoprene, and are
  consistent in their spatial variability over the Southeast US (r = 0.4-0.8 on
  a 0.5 by 0.5 grid) as well as their day-to-day variability (r = 0.5-0.8).
  However, all satellite retrievals are biased low in the mean by 20-51 %,
  which would lead to corresponding bias in estimates of isoprene emissions
  from the satellite data. The smallest bias is for OMI-BIRA, which has the
  highest corrected slant columns and the lowest scattering weights in its air
  mass factor (AMF) calculation. Correcting the assumed HCHO vertical profiles
  (shape factors) used in the AMF calculation would further reduce the bias in
  the OMI-BIRA data. We conclude that current satellite HCHO data provide a
  reliable proxy for isoprene emission variability but with a low mean bias due
  both to the corrected slant columns and the scattering weights used in the
  retrievals.%

  We present the new version (v14) of the BIRA-IASB algorithm for the retrieval
  of formaldehyde (H2CO) columns from spaceborne UV-Visible sensors. Applied to
  OMI measurements from Aura and to GOME-2 measurements from MetOp-A and B,
  this algorithm is used to produce global distributions of H2CO representative
  of mid-morning and early afternoon conditions. Its main features include (1)
  a new iterative DOAS scheme involving three fitting intervals to better
  account for the O2-O2 absorption, (2) the use of earthshine radiances
  averaged in the equatorial Pacific as reference spectra, (3) a destriping
  correction and background normalisation resolved in the along-swath position.
  For the air mass factor calculation, a priori vertical profiles calculated by
  the IMAGES chemistry transport model at 9.30 a.m. and 13.30 p.m. are used.
  Although the resulting GOME-2 and OMI H2CO vertical columns are found to be
  highly correlated, some systematic differences are observed. Afternoon
  columns are generally larger than morning ones, especially in mid-latitude
  regions. In contrast, over tropical rainforests, morning H2CO columns
  significantly exceed those observed in the afternoon. These differences are
  discussed in terms of the H2CO column variation between mid-morning and early
  afternoon, using ground-based MAX-DOAS measurements available from seven
  stations in Europe, China and Africa. Validation results confirm the capacity
  of the combined satellite measurements to resolve diurnal variations in H2CO
  columns. Furthermore, vertical profiles derived from MAX-DOAS measurements in
  the Beijing area and in Bujumbura are used for a more detailed validation
  exercise. In both regions, we find an agreement better than 15% when MAX-DOAS
  profiles are used as a priori for the satellite retrievals. Finally regional
  trends in H2CO columns are estimated for the 2004–2014 period using
  SCIAMACHY and GOME-2 data for morning conditions, and OMI for early afternoon
  conditions. Consistent features are observed such as an increase of the
  columns in India and Central-East China, and a decrease in Eastern US and
  Europe. We find that the higher horizontal resolution of OMI combined to a
  better sampling and a more favourable illumination at mid-day allow for more
  significant trend estimates, especially over Europe and North America.
  Importantly, in some parts of the Amazonian forest, we observe with both time
  series a significant downward trend in H2CO columns, spatially correlated
  with areas affected by deforestation.%

  We use formaldehyde (HCHO) vertical column measurements from the Scanning
  Imaging Absorption spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) and
  Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and a nested-grid version of the GEOS-Chem
  chemistry transport model, to infer an ensemble of top-down isoprene emission
  estimates from tropical South America during 2006, using different model
  configurations and assumptions in the HCHO air-mass factor (AMF) calculation.
  Scenes affected by biomass burning are removed on a daily basis using fire
  count observations, and we use the local model sensitivity to identify
  locations where the impact of spatial smearing is small, though this
  comprises spatial coverage over the region. We find that the use of the HCHO
  column data more tightly constrains the ensemble isoprene emission range from
  27-61TgC to 31-38TgC for SCIAMACHY, and 45-104TgC to 28-38TgC for OMI. Median
  uncertainties of the top-down emissions are about 60-260% for SCIAMACHY, and
  10-90% for OMI. We find that the inferred emissions are most sensitive to
  uncertainties in cloud fraction and cloud top pressure (differences of +/-
  10%), the a priori isoprene emissions (+/- 20%), and the HCHO vertical column
  retrieval (+/- 30%). Construction of continuous top-down emission maps
  generally improves GEOS-Chem's simulation of HCHO columns over the region,
  with respect to both the SCIAMACHY and OMI data. However, if local time
  top-down emissions are scaled to monthly mean values, the annual emission
  inferred from SCIAMACHY are nearly twice those from OMI. This difference
  cannot be explained by the different sampling of the sensors or uncertainties
  in the AMF calculation.%

  We present a new dataset of formaldehyde vertical columns retrieved from
  observations of GOME-2 on board the EUMETSAT MetOp-A platform between 2007
  and 2011. The new retrieval scheme, which has been optimised for GOME-2,
  includes a two-step fitting procedure that strongly reduces the impact of
  spectral interferences between H2CO and BrO, and a modified DOAS approach
  that better handles ozone absorption effects at moderately low sun
  elevations. Owing to these new features, the noise in the H2CO slant columns
  is reduced by up to 40% in comparison to baseline retrieval settings used
  operationally. Also, the previously reported underestimation of the H2CO
  columns in tropical and mid-latitude regions has been largely eliminated,
  improving the agreement with coincident SCIAMACHY observations. To compensate
  for the drift of the GOME-2 slit function and to mitigate the instrumental
  degradation effects on H2CO retrievals, an asymmetric Gaussian line-shape is
  fitted during the irradiance calibration. Additionally, external parameters
  used in the tropospheric air mass factor computation (surface reflectances,
  cloud parameters and a priori profile shapes of H2CO) have been updated using
  most recent databases. Similar updates were also applied to the historical
  datasets of GOME and SCIAMACHY, leading to the generation of a consistent
  multi-mission H2CO data record covering the time period from 1997 until 2011.
  Comparing the resulting time series of monthly averaged H2CO vertical columns
  in 12 large regions worldwide, the correlation coefficient between SCIAMACHY
  and GOME-2 columns is generally higher than 0.8 in the overlap period, and
  linear regression slopes differ by less than 10% from unity in most of the
  regions. In comparison to SCIAMACHY, the largely improved spatial sampling of
  GOME-2 allows for a better characterisation of formaldehyde distribution at
  the regional scale and/or at shorter timescales, leading to a better
  identification of the emission sources of non-methane volatile organic
  compounds.%

  Emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) are a chief
  uncertainty in calculating the burdens of important atmospheric compounds
  like tropospheric ozone or secondary organic aerosol, reflecting either
  imperfect chemical oxidation mechanisms or unreliable emission estimates, or
  both. To provide a starting point for a more systematic discussion we review
  here global isoprene and monoterpene emission estimates to-date. We note a
  surprisingly small variation in the predictions of global isoprene emission
  rate that is in stark contrast with our lack of process understanding and the
  small number of observations for model parameterisation and evaluation. Most
  of 10 the models are based on similar emission algorithms, using fixed values
  for the emission capacity of various plant functional types. In some studies
  these values are very similar, but they differ substantially in others. The
  models differ also broadly with regard to their representation of net primary
  productivity, method of biome coverage determination and climate data. Their
  similarities with regard to the global isoprene emission 15 rate would
  suggest that the dominant parameters driving the ultimate global estimate,
  and thus the dominant determinant of model sensitivity, are the specific
  emission algorithm and isoprene emission capacity. Contrary to isoprene,
  monoterpene estimates show significantly larger model-to-model variation
  although variation in terms of leaf algorithm, emission capacities, the way
  of model upscaling, vegetation cover or climatology used in terpene models
  are comparable to those used for isoprene. From our summary of published
  studies there appears to be no evidence that the terrestrial modelling
  community has been any more successful in “resolving unknowns” in the
  mechanisms that control global isoprene emissions, compared to global
  monoterpene emissions. Rather, the proliferation of common parameterization
  schemes within a 25 large variety of model platforms lends the illusion of
  convergence towards a common estimate of global isoprene emissions. This
  convergence might be used to provide optimism that the community has reached
  the “relief phase”, the phase when sufficient process understanding and
  data for evaluation allows for models to converge, when applying a recently
  proposed concept. We argue that there is no basis for this appar- ent
  “relief” phase. Rather, we urge modellers to be bolder in their analysis
  to draw attention to the fact that terrestrial emissions, particularly in the
  area of biome-specific emission capacities, are unknown rather than
  uncertain.%

  The rate of constitutive isoprenoid emissions from plants is driven by plant
  emission capacity under specified environmental conditions (Es, the emission
  factor) and by responsiveness of the emissions to instantaneous variations in
  environment. In models of isoprenoid emission, Es has been often considered
  as intrinsic species-specific constant invariable in time and space. Here we
  analyze the variations in species-specific values of E s under field
  conditions focusing on abiotic stresses, past environmental conditions and
  developmental processes. The reviewed studies highlight strong stress-driven,
  adaptive (previous temperature and light environment and growth CO2
  concentration) and developmental (leaf age) variations in Es values operating
  at medium to long time scales. These biological factors can alter
  species-specific Es values by more than an order of magnitude. While the
  majority of models based on early concepts still ignore these important
  sources of variation, recent models are including some of the medium- to
  long-term controls. However, conceptually different strategies are being used
  for incorporation of these longer-term controls with important practical
  implications for parameterization and application of these models. This
  analysis emphasizes the need to include more biological realism in the
  isoprenoid emission models and also highlights the gaps in knowledge that
  require further experimental work to reduce the model uncertainties
  associated with biological sources of variation. {\textcopyright} Author(s)

  \field{abstract}{%
  Ozone holds a certain fascination in atmospheric science. It is ubiquitous in
  the atmosphere, central to tropospheric oxidation chemistry, yet harmful to
  human and ecosystem health as well as being an important greenhouse gas. It
  is not emitted into the atmosphere but is a byproduct of the very oxidation
  chemistry it largely initiates. Much effort is focused on the reduction of
  surface levels of ozone owing to its health and vegetation impacts, but
  recent efforts to achieve reductions in exposure at a country scale have
  proved difficult to achieve owing to increases in background ozone at the
  zonal hemispheric scale. There is also a growing realisation that the role of
  ozone as a short-lived climate pollutant could be important in integrated air
  quality climate change mitigation. This review examines current understanding
  of the processes regulating tropospheric ozone at global to local scales from
  both measurements and models. It takes the view that knowledge across the
  scales is important for dealing with air quality and climate change in a
  synergistic manner. The review shows that there remain a number of clear
  challenges for ozone such as explaining surface trends, incorporating new
  chemical understanding, ozone–climate coupling, and a better assessment of
  impacts. There is a clear and present need to treat ozone across the range of
  scales, a transboundary issue, but with an emphasis on the hemispheric
  scales. New observational opportunities are offered both by satellites and
  small sensors that bridge the scales.%

  Isoprene is the largest single VOC emission to the atmosphere. Although it is
  primarily oxidized photochemically during daylight hours, late-day emissions
  that remain in the atmosphere at sunset undergo oxidation by NO3 in
  regionally polluted areas with large NOx levels. A recent aircraft study
  examined isoprene and its nocturnal oxidants in a series of night flights
  across the Northeast US, a region with large emissions of both isoprene and
  NOx. Substantial amounts of isoprene that were observed after dark were
  strongly anticorrelated with measured NO3 and were the most important factor
  determining the lifetime of this radical. The products of photochemical
  oxidation of isoprene, methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein, were more
  uniformly distributed, and served as tracers for the presence of isoprene at
  sunset, prior to its oxidation by NO3. A determination of the mass of
  isoprene oxidized in darkness showed it to be a large fraction (>20%) of
  emitted isoprene. Organic nitrates produced from the NO3+isoprene reaction,
  though not directly measured, were estimated to account for 2-9% of total
  reactive nitrogen. The mass of isoprene oxidized by NO3 was comparable to and
  correlated with the organic aerosol loading for flights with relatively low
  organic aerosol background. The contribution of nocturnal isoprene oxidation
  to secondary organic aerosol was determined in the range 1 17%, and isoprene
  SOA mass derived from NO3 was calculated to exceed that due to OH by
  approximately 50%.%

  We implement a new isoprene oxidation mechanism in a global 3-D chemical
  transport model (GEOS-Chem). Model results are evaluated with observations
  for ozone, isoprene oxidation products, and related species from the
  International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and
  Transformation aircraft campaign over the eastern United States in summer
  2004. The model achieves an unbiased simulation of ozone in the boundary
  layer and the free troposphere, reflecting canceling effects from recent
  model updates for isoprene chemistry, bromine chemistry, and HO2 loss to
  aerosols. Simulation of the ozone-CO correlation is improved relative to
  previous versions of the model, and this is attributed to a lower and
  reversible yield of isoprene nitrates, increasing the ozone production
  efficiency per unit of nitrogen oxides (NOx ≡ NO + NO2). The model
  successfully reproduces the observed concentrations of organic nitrates
  (∑ANs) and their correlations with HCHO and ozone. ∑ANs in the model is
  principally composed of secondary isoprene nitrates, including a major
  contribution from nighttime isoprene oxidation. The correlations of ∑ANs
  with HCHO and ozone then provide sensitive tests of isoprene chemistry and
  argue in particular against a fast isomerization channel for isoprene peroxy
  radicals. ∑ANs can provide an important reservoir for exporting NOx from
  the U.S. boundary layer. We find that the dependence of surface ozone on
  isoprene emission is positive throughout the U.S., even if NOx emissions are
  reduced by a factor of 4. Previous models showed negative dependences that we
  attribute to erroneous titration of OH by isoprene.%

  Global vegetation is intrinsically linked to atmospheric chemistry and

  Environmental Context. Many plant species biosynthesize and emit the volatile
  hydrocarbon isoprene. Once in the atmosphere, isoprene is susceptible to a
  range of reactions involving potentially hundred of products and intermediate
  compounds. The products of these reactions in turn may pose a risk to human
  and plant health and impact the climate through the generation of acids,
  ozone, and atmospheric aerosols. Abstract. The atmospheric oxidation
  mechanism of isoprene initiated by OH, O3, NO3, and Cl, which incorporates
  the most recent laboratory and theoretical studies, is described. A box model
  intercomparison between the new mechanism and previous available isoprene
  oxidation mechanisms has been performed. Ozone and OH concentrations are
  compared with predictions by the previous mechanisms in high and low NOx
  scenarios. The O3 and OH sensitivities to the chlorine-isoprene reactions
  have also been investigated by comparing the box model results with and
  without the chlorine-isoprene reactions, showing that the ozone production
  rate and OH concentrations are slightly impacted. The new mechanism
  facilitates more accurate modelling of isoprene photochemistry in the
  atmosphere.%

  Formaldehyde (HCHO) columns measured from space by solar UV backscatter allow
  mapping of reactive hydrocarbon emissions. The principal contributor to these
  emissions during the growing season is the biogenic hydrocarbon isoprene,
  which is of great importance for driving regional and global tropospheric
  chemistry. We present seven years (1995 - 2001) of HCHO column data for North
  America from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), and show that the
  general seasonal and interannual variability of these data is consistent with
  knowledge of isoprene emission. There are some significant regional
  discrepancies with the seasonal patterns predicted from current isoprene
  emission models, and we suggest that these may reflect flaws in the models.
  The interannual variability of HCHO columns observed by GOME appears to
  follow the interannual variability of surface temperature, as expected from
  current isoprene emission models.%

  Formaldehyde (HCHO) being a high-yield product in the oxidation of most
  volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by fires, vegetation and
  anthropogenic activities, satellite observations of HCHO are well-suited to
  inform us on the spatial and temporal variability of the underlying VOC
  sources. The long-record of space-based HCHO column observations from the
  Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is used to infer emission flux estimates
  from pyrogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the global
  scale over 2005–2013. This is realized through the method of source inverse
  modelling, which consists in the optimization of emissions in a
  chemistry-transport model (CTM) in order to minimize the discrepancy between
  the observed and modelled HCHO columns. The top-down fluxes are derived in
  the global CTM IMAGESv2 by an iterative minimization algorithm based on the
  full adjoint of IMAGESv2, starting from a priori emission estimates provided
  by the newly released GFED4s (Global Fire Emission Database, version 4s)
  inventory for fires, and by the MEGAN-MOHYCAN inventory for isoprene
  emissions. The top-down fluxes are compared to two independent inventories
  for fire (GFAS and FINNv1.5) and isoprene emissions (MEGAN-MACC and
  GUESS-ES). The inversion indicates a moderate decrease (ca. 20 %) of the
  average annual global fire and isoprene emissions, from 2028 TgC in the a
  priori to 1653 TgC for burnt biomass, and from 343 to 272 Tg for isoprene
  fluxes. Those estimates are acknowledged to depend on the accuracy of
  formaldehyde data, as well as on the assumed fire emission factors and the
  oxidation mechanisms leading to HCHO production. Strongly decreased top-down
  fire fluxes (30–50 %) are inferred in the peak fire season in Africa, and
  during years with strong a priori fluxes associated to forest fires in
  Amazonia (in 2005, 2007 and 2010), bushfires in Australia (in 2006 and 2011),
  and peat burning in Indonesia (in 2006 and 2009), whereas generally increased
  fluxes are suggested in Indochina and during the 2007 fires in Southern
  Europe. Moreover, changes in fire seasonal patterns are suggested, e.g. the
  seasonal amplitude is reduced over Southeast Asia. In Africa, the inversion
  indicates increased fluxes due to agricultural fires, and decreased maxima
  when natural fires are dominant. The top-down fire emissions are much better
  correlated with MODIS fire counts than the a priori inventory in regions with
  small and agricultural fires, indicating that the OMI-based inversion is
  well-suited to assess the associated emissions. Regarding biogenic sources,
  significant reductions of isoprene fluxes are inferred in tropical ecosystems
  (30–40 %), suggesting overestimated basal emission rates in those areas in
  the bottom-up inventory, whereas strongly positive isoprene emission updates
  are derived over semi-arid and desert areas, especially in Southern Africa
  and Australia. This finding suggests that the parameterization of the soil
  moisture stress used in MEGAN greatly exaggerates the flux reduction due to
  drought in those regions. The isoprene emission trends over 2005–2013 are
  often enhanced after optimization, with positive top-down trends in Siberia
  (4.2 %/yr) and Eastern Europe (3.9 %/yr), likely reflecting forest expansion
  and warming temperatures, and negative trends in Amazonia (−2.1 %/yr),
  South China (−1 %/yr), the United States (−3.7 %/yr), and Western Europe
  (−3.3 %/yr), which are generally corroborated by independent studies, yet
  their interpretation warrants further investigation.%

  Quantifying isoprene emissions using satellite observations of the
  formaldehyde (HCHO) columns is subject to errors involving the column
  retrieval and the assumed relationship between HCHO columns and isoprene
  emissions, taken here from the GEOS-CHEM chemical transport model. Here we
  use a 6-year (1996–2001) HCHO column data set from the Global Ozone
  Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite instrument to (1) quantify these
  errors, (2) evaluate GOME-derived isoprene emissions with in situ flux
  measurements and a process-based emission inventory (Model of Emissions of
  Gases and Aerosols from Nature, MEGAN), and (3) investigate the factors
  driving the seasonal and interannual variability of North American isoprene
  emissions. The error in the GOME HCHO column retrieval is estimated to be
  40%. We use the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) to quantify the
  time-dependent HCHO production from isoprene, $\alpha$- and $\beta$-pinenes,
  and methylbutenol and show that only emissions of isoprene are detectable by
  GOME. The time-dependent HCHO yield from isoprene oxidation calculated by MCM
  is 20–30% larger than in GEOS-CHEM. GOME-derived isoprene fluxes track the
  observed seasonal variation of in situ measurements at a Michigan forest site
  with a −30% bias. The seasonal variation of North American isoprene
  emissions during 2001 inferred from GOME is similar to MEGAN, with GOME
  emissions typically 25% higher (lower) at the beginning (end) of the growing
  season. GOME and MEGAN both show a maximum over the southeastern United
  States, but they differ in the precise location. The observed interannual
  variability of this maximum is 20–30%, depending on month. The MEGAN
  isoprene emission dependence on surface air temperature explains 75% of the
  month-to-month variability in GOME-derived isoprene emissions over the
  southeastern United States during May–September 1996–2001.%

  Emission of non-methane Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) to the atmosphere
  stems from biogenic and human activities, and their estimation is difficult
  because of the many and not fully understood processes involved. In order to
  narrow down the uncertainty related to VOC emissions, which negatively
  reflects on our ability to simulate the atmospheric composition, we exploit
  satellite observations of formaldehyde (HCHO), an ubiquitous oxidation
  product of most VOCs, focusing on Europe. HCHO column observations from the
  Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) reveal a marked seasonal cycle with a
  summer maximum and winter minimum. In summer, the oxidation of methane and
  other long-lived VOCs supply a slowly varying background HCHO column, while
  HCHO variability is dominated by most reactive VOC, primarily biogenic
  isoprene followed in importance by biogenic terpenes and anthropogenic VOCs.
  The chemistry-transport model CHIMERE qualitatively reproduces the temporal
  and spatial features of the observed HCHO column, but display regional biases
  which are attributed mainly to incorrect biogenic VOC emissions, calculated
  with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosol from Nature (MEGAN)
  algorithm. These "bottom-up" or a-priori emissions are corrected through a
  Bayesian inversion of the OMI HCHO observations. Resulting "top-down" or
  a-posteriori isoprene emissions are lower than "bottom-up" by 40% over the
  Balkans and by 20% over Southern Germany, and higher by 20% over Iberian
  Peninsula, Greece and Italy. We conclude that OMI satellite observations of
  HCHO can provide a quantitative "top-down" constraint on the European
  "bottom-up" VOC inventories.%

  We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to estimate the impact
  of transpacific transport of mineral dust on aerosol concentrations in North
  America during 2001. We have implemented two dust mobilization schemes in the
  model (GOCART and DEAD) and find that the best simulation of North American
  surface observations with GEOS-Chem is achieved by combining the topographic
  source used in GOCART with the entrainment scheme used in DEAD. This
  combination restricts dust emissions to year-round arid areas but includes a
  significant wind threshold for dust mobilization. The model captures the
  magnitude and seasonal cycle of observed surface dust concentrations over the
  northern Pacific. It simulates the free tropospheric outflow of dust from
  Asia observed in the TRACE-P and ACE-Asia aircraft campaigns of spring 2001.
  It reproduces the timing and distribution of Asian dust outbreaks in North
  America during April-May. Beyond these outbreaks we find persistent Asian
  fine dust (averaging 1.2 ??g m-3) in surface air over the western United
  States in spring, with much weaker influence (0.25 ??g m-3) in summer and
  fall. Asian influence over the eastern United States is 30-50% lower. We find
  that transpacific sources accounted for 41% of the worst dust days in the
  western United States in 2001. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  A high-resolution section of dissolved iron (dFe) and aluminum (dAl) was
  obtained along $\sim$95°E in the upper 1000m of the eastern Indian Ocean
  from the Antarctic margin (66°S) to the Bay of Bengal (18°N) during the
  U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) CO2 Repeat Hydrography
  I08S and I09N sections (February–April 2007). In the Southern Ocean, low
  concentrations of dAl (<1nM) reflect the negligible dust inputs impacting the
  water masses subducted in the circumpolar domain. The low dAl concentrations
  characterizing the Southern Ocean terminate near 45°S, probably because of
  the advection of subtropical water masses that received dust and sedimentary
  inputs in their formation region. Our subsurface dFe data near the southern
  Kerguelen Plateau were significantly higher than historical observations in
  other Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean. We surmise that the offshore
  advection of dFe-rich waters along the western flank of the southern
  Kerguelen plateau and enhanced vertical mixing could contribute to this
  elevated subsurface dFe inventory. Elevated subsurface particulate and dFe
  levels downstream of the northern Kerguelen Plateaumay reflect long-range
  lateral transport from the plateau's sediments and/or remineralization
  inputs. At the northern edge of the south Indian subtropical gyre, the
  deposition of Australian dust, possibly combined with the advection of
  dAl-enriched waters from the Indonesian Throughflow, creates a region of
  elevated dAl in the upper 400m but without a corresponding enrichment in dFe.
  In the northern Indian Ocean, the South Equatorial Current constitutes a
  remarkable biogeochemical front separating the oxygen-rich and dFe-poor
  subtropical gyre waters from the dFe-rich and oxygen-depleted waters of the
  northern Indian Ocean. By tracing the accumulation of macronutrients and dFe
  along the advective pathway of Indian Central Water, we show that the central
  waters of the northern Indian Ocean receive excess dFe in addition to that
  produced by remineralization inputs. The resuspension of shelf sediments and
  release of pore waters probably contribute%

  The Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) method is used
  extensively to retrieve total column amounts of trace gases based on
  UV-visible measurements of satellite spectrometers, such as ERS-2 GOME. In
  practice the sensitivity of the instrument to the tracer density is strongly
  height dependent, especially in the troposphere. The resulting tracer profile
  dependence may introduce large systematic errors in the retrieved columns
  that are difficult to quantify without proper additional information, as
  provided by the averaging kernel (AK). In this paper we discuss the DOAS
  retrieval method in the context of the general retrieval theory as developed
  by Rodgers. An expression is derived for the DOAS AK for optically thin
  absorbers. It is shown that the comparison with 3D chemistry-transport models
  and independent profile measurements, based on averaging kernels, is no
  longer influenced by errors resulting from a priori profile assumptions. The
  availability of averaging kernel information as part of the total column
  retrieval product is important for the interpretation of the observations,
  and for applications like chemical data assimilation and detailed satellite
  validation studies.%

  In this paper, we examine the tropical lower stratosphere and upper
  troposphere and elucidate the key role of ozone changes in driving
  temperature trends in this region. We use a radiative fixed dynamical heating
  model to show that the effects of tropical ozone decreases at 70 hPa and
  lower pressures can lead to significant cooling not only at stratospheric
  levels, but also in the ''sub-stratosphere/ upper tropospheric'' region
  around 150-70 hPa. The impact of stratospheric ozone depletion on upper
  tropospheric temperatures stems from reduced longwave emission from above.
  The results provide a possible explanation for the long-standing discrepancy
  between modeled and measured temperature trends in the uppermost tropical
  troposphere and can explain the latitudinal near-homogeneity of recent
  stratospheric temperature trends.%

  Ozone (O3) from 17 atm. chem. models taking part in the Atm. Chem. and
  Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) has been used to calc.
  tropospheric ozone radiative forcings (RFs). All models applied a common set
  of anthropogenic emissions, which are better constrained for the present-day
  than the past. Future anthropogenic emissions follow the four Representative
  Concn. Pathway (RCP) scenarios, which define a relatively narrow range of
  possible air pollution emissions. We calc. a value for the pre-industrial
  (1750) to present-day (2010) tropospheric ozone RF of 410 mW m-2. The model
  range of pre-industrial to present-day changes in O3 produces a spread
  ({\^{A}}±1 std. deviation) in RFs of {\^{A}}±17%. Three different radiation
  schemes were used - we find differences in RFs between schemes (for the same
  ozone fields) of {\^{A}}±10%. Applying two different tropopause definitions
  gives differences in RFs of {\^{A}}±3%. Given addnl. (unquantified)
  uncertainties assocd. with emissions, climate-chem. interactions and land-use
  change, we est. an overall uncertainty of {\^{A}}±30% for the tropospheric
  ozone RF. Expts. carried out by a subset of six models attribute tropospheric
  ozone RF to increased emissions of methane (44 {\^{A}}± 12 %), nitrogen
  oxides (31 {\^{A}}± 9 %), carbon monoxide (15 {\^{A}}± 3 %) and non-methane
  volatile org. compds. (9 {\^{A}}± 2 %); earlier studies attributed more of
  the tropospheric ozone RF to methane and less to nitrogen oxides. Normalizing
  RFs to changes in tropospheric column ozone, we find a global mean normalized
  RF of 42 mW m-2 DU-1, a value similar to previous work. Using normalized RFs
  and future tropospheric column ozone projections we calc. future tropospheric
  ozone RFs (mW m-2; relative to 1750) for the four future scenarios (RCP2.6,
  RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) of 350, 420, 370 and 460 (in 2030), and 200, 300,
  280 and 600 (in 2100). Models show some coherent responses of ozone to
  climate change: decreases in the tropical lower troposphere, assocd. with
  increases in water vapor; and increases in the sub-tropical to mid-latitude
  upper troposphere, assocd. with increases in lightning and
  stratosphere-to-troposphere transport. Climate change has relatively small
  impacts on global mean tropospheric ozone RF. on SciFinder(R)]%

  We assess the human health and economic impacts of projected 2000–2050
  changes in ozone pollution using the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy
  Analysis - Health Effects (EPPA-HE) model, in combination with results from
  the GEOS-Chem global tropospheric chemistry model of climate and chemistry
  effects of projected future emissions. We use EPPA-HE to assess the human
  health damages (including mortality and morbidity) caused by ozone pollution,
  and quantify their economic impacts in sixteen world regions. We compare the
  costs of ozone pollution under scenarios with 2000 and 2050 ozone precursor
  and greenhouse gas emissions (using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
  Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario). We
  estimate that health costs due to global ozone pollution above pre-industrial
  levels by 2050 will be $580 billion (year 2000$) and that mortalities from
  acute exposure will exceed 2 million. We ﬁnd that previous methodologies
  underestimate costs of air pollution by more than a third because they do not
  take into account the long-term, compounding effects of health costs. The
  economic effects of emissions changes far exceed the inﬂuence of climate
  alone.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  A new methodology is proposed to identify folds of the dynamical tropopause
  (taken as the 2 potential vorticity (PV) units (pvu) isosurface) from global
  analysis data sets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
  Forecasts (ECMWF). It consists of a three-dimensional subdivision of the
  atmosphere into stratospheric and tropospheric parts and a subsequent
  examination of multiple tropopause crossings in vertical profiles of the
  analyses. The method is applied to a 1-year period starting in March 2000.
  Seasonal mean fold frequency distributions show that folds occur
  preferentially in the subtropics, with maximum frequencies of about 30%.
  Pronounced maxima are located in the subtropical bands that extend from
  20{\^{A}}°E to 120{\^{A}}°E on both hemispheres during summer. Generally,
  subtropical folds are comparatively shallow. Deep folds occur most frequently
  in midlatitudes during winter (over eastern North America and the western
  North Atlantic), with maximum frequencies of about 1%. Detailed investigation
  of the relationship between individual folds and cross-tropopause exchange
  events reveals that, on the average, individual folds in the extratropics are
  associated with larger exchange mass fluxes compared to the subtropics.
  However, due to the much higher frequency of subtropical folds, the
  percentage of exchange events that are associated with tropopause folds is
  larger near 20{\^{A}}°{\^{a}}€“40{\^{A}}° latitude (50{\^{a}}€“70%)
  than further poleward (20{\^{a}}€“30% during winter and
  10{\^{a}}€“20% during summer). This indicates that tropopause folds are
  the key feature for cross-tropopause exchange in the subtropics, whereas in
  the extratropics other tropopause structures are at least of equal
  importance.%

  Abstract. Tropopause folds are one of the mechanisms of
  stratosphere–troposphere exchange, which can bring ozone rich stratospheric
  air to low altitudes in the extra-tropical regions. They have been widely
  studied at northern mid- or high latitudes, but so far almost no studies have
  been made at mid- or high southern latitudes. The Moveable Atmospheric Radar
  for Antarctica (MARA), a 54.5 MHz wind-profiler radar, has operated at the
  Swedish summer station Wasa, Antarctica (73° S, 13.5° W) during austral
  summer seasons from 2007 to 2011 and has observed on several occasions
  signatures similar to those caused by tropopause folds at comparable Arctic
  latitudes. Here a case study is presented of one of these events when an
  ozonesonde successfully sampled the fold. Analysis from European Center for
  Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) is used to study the circumstances
  surrounding the event, and as boundary conditions for a mesoscale simulation
  using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The fold is well
  resolved by the WRF simulation, and occurs on the poleward side of the polar
  jet stream. However, MARA resolves fine-scale layering associated with the
  fold better than the WRF simulation.%

  Abstract. A wide range of measurements was carried out in central and
  southeastern Europe within the framework of the EU project STACCATO
  (Influence of Stratosphere-Troposphere Exchange in a Changing Climate on
  Atmospheric Transport and Oxidation Capacity) with the principle goal to
  create a comprehensive data set on stratospheric air intrusions into the
  troposphere along a rather frequently observed pathway over central Europe
  from the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The measurements were based on
  predictions by suitable quasi-operational trajectory calculations using ECMWF
  forecast data. A predicted deep Stratosphere to Troposphere Transport (STT)
  event, encountered during the STACCATO period on 20-21 June 2001, was
  followed by the measurements network almost from its inception. Observations
  provide evidence that the intrusion affected large parts of central and
  southeastern Europe. Especially, the ozone lidar observations on 20-21 June
  2001 at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany captured the evolution of two marked
  tongues of high ozone with the first one descending to nearly 2 km, thus
  providing an excellent data set for model intercomparisons and validation. In
  addition, for the first time to our knowledge concurrent surface measurements
  of the cosmogenic radionuclides 10Be and 7Be and their ratio 10Be/7Be are
  presented together as stratospheric tracers in a case study of a
  stratospheric intrusion. The ozone tracer columns calculated with the
  FLEXPART model were found to be in good agreement with water vapour satellite
  images, capturing the evolution of the observed dry streamers of
  stratospheric origin. Furthermore, the time-height cross section of ozone
  tracer simulated with FLEXPART over Garmisch-Partenkirchen captures many
  details of the evolution of the two observed high-ozone filaments measured
  with the IFU lidar, thus demonstrating the considerable progress in model
  simulations. Finally, the modelled ozone (operationally available since
  October 1999) from the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
  Forecasts) atmospheric model is shown to be in very good agreement with the
  observations during this case study, which provides the first successful
  validation of a chemical tracer that is derived operationally from a weather
  forecast model. This suggests that coupling chemistry and weather forecast
  models may significantly improve both weather and chemical forecasts in the
  future.%

  The geographic and temporal variations in tropospheric and stratospheric
  ozone columns from individual swath measurements of the Ozone Monitoring
  Instrument (OMI), on the NASA Aura spacecraft, are reasonably well simulated
  by the University of California, Irvine (UCI) chemistry transport model (CTM)
  using 1 degrees x 1 degrees x 40-layer meteorological fields for the year
  2005. From the CTM we find that high-frequency spatial variations in
  tropospheric column ozone (TCO), including around the jet streams, are not
  generally correlated with variations in stratospheric ozone column, but
  instead are collocated with folding events involving stratospheric-origin,
  high-ozone layers below the tropopause. The CTM fold events are verified in
  many cases with available ozone sondes. Using the OMI Level 2 profiles, and
  defining tropopause height from our CTM using the European Centre for
  Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fields, we find that most of the
  variations in TCO near CTM folding events are also not correlated with those
  in stratospheric ozone column. A large fraction of the OMI TCO variance is
  accurately simulated by the CTM where the variance is significant, especially
  along the subtropical jets. The absolute tropospheric columns from OMI and
  CTM agree swath-by-swath, pixel-by-pixel within +/- 5 Dobson Units (DU) for
  most cases. Notable exceptions are in the tropics where neither the high
  ozone from biomass burning nor the low ozone in the convergence zones over
  the Pacific is found in the OMI observations, because of OMI's insensitivity
  to the lower troposphere. Another difference is identified with the OMI
  profiles near the southern subtropical jet. The CTM has a high bias in
  stratospheric column outside the tropics, due to problems previously
  identified with the stratospheric circulation in the 40-layer meteorological
  fields. Overall, we identify ozone folds with short-lived features in TCO
  that have scales of a few hundred kilometres as observed by OMI.%

  {Abstract. Two years of Very High Frequency (VHF) radar echo power
  observations are used to examine the structure and variability of the
  tropopause at Davis, Antarctica. Co-located radiosonde and ozonesonde
  launches provide data with which to calculate the lapse-rate and chemical
  tropopauses. The radar tropopause, defined as the maximum vertical gradient
  of echo return power, can be used as a definition of the Antarctic tropopause
  throughout the year under all meteorological conditions. During the extended
  summer period of December–April (DJFMA) inclusive, radar tropopauses are
  (0.2 ± 0.4) km lower than radiosonde lapse-rate (i.e. the World
  Meteorological Organisation – WMO) tropopauses and during the extended
  winter period of June–October (JJASO) inclusive, the radar tropopauses are
  (0.8 ± 1.0) km lower. A potential vorticity tropopause is defined as the
  altitude of the −2 PVU surface (where 1 PVU = 106 m2 s−1 K kg−1). This
  is (0.3 ± 0.5) km lower than the radar tropopause during DJFMA and (0.5 ±
  1.0) km lower during JJASO. The radar, potential vorticity and ozone
  tropopauses decrease in altitude during increasingly strong cyclonic
  conditions, in contrast to the radiosonde WMO tropopause which remains nearly
  constant. During strong JJASO cyclonic conditions, there are large (several
  km) differences between WMO tropopause altitudes and radar tropopause
  altitudes. A seasonal cycle in tropopause fold occurrence is observed, with
  approximately a three-fold increase during JJASO.} Tropopause Definition

  ERA-Interim is the latest global atmospheric reanalysis produced by the
  European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The ERA-Interim
  project was conducted in part to prepare for a new atmospheric reanalysis to
  replace ERA-40, which will extend back to the early part of the twentieth

  and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance
  of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered
  in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological
  cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in
  time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial
  improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further

  \field{abstract}{%
  A comparison has been conducted of the height and sharpness of the tropopause
  as revealed by temperature and ozone profiles. In the study, 628 ECC-type
  ozonesonde profiles from four stations in northern Europe were used. Two
  tropopauses were defined for each profile: a thermal tropopause and an ozone
  tropopause defined in terms of both mixing ratio and vertical gradient of
  mixing ratio. On average, the ozone tropopause lay 800 m below the thermal.
  Large differences in tropopause height were associated with indefinite
  thermal tropopauses which were, in turn, often associated with cyclonic
  conditions (some corresponding to profiles taken within the stratospheric
  polar vortex). On almost all profiles the thermal tropopause was the higher
  of the two, and of the 15 profiles that did not fit this pattern, two-thirds
  were associated with anticyclonic flow in the upper troposphere. It is also
  shown that the tropopause definition impacts greatly on the evaluation of the
  ozone content of the troposphere. Where the thermal tropopause is indefinite
  in character, on average 27% of the ozone found below the thermal tropopause
  lies above the ozone tropopause.%

  Several studies have observed midtropospheric atmospheric composition
  anomalies and suggested a link to tropical biomass burning. Such anomalies
  complicate the use of trace gas profiles in remote regions to infer their
  surface sources/sinks based on the vertical gradients. The Southern African
  Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI 2000) campaign in Africa and coordinated
  downwind measurements in Australia provided an opportunity to confirm this
  link and elucidate the specific surface and atmospheric processes. Five
  aircraft missions were conducted by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
  Research Organisation (CSIRO) Atmospheric Research during the campaign. They
  were scheduled after African outflows of polluted air were observed in
  satellite images over the Indian Ocean flowing east toward Australia. Air
  samples collected from near the surface to 7 km were analyzed for a suite of
  trace gases ( 12CO 2, CH 4, CO, H 2, N 2O, and C 2 and C 3 hydrocarbons) and
  one isotopomer ( 13CO 2 to provide vertical composition profiles. Ozone was
  monitored continuously during flight while a groundbased lidar was employed
  in the Melbourne region to detect aerosol layers. A preliminary statistical
  analysis on the Australian data confirms covarying midroposphere enhancements
  in the biomass burning products. Making rudimentary corrections for
  photochemical evolution during transit, the trace gas enhancement ratios in
  affected air samples are comparable to emission ratios in fresh biomass
  burning plumes. The 13CO 2/ 12CO 2 ratios are also consistent with a source
  from terrestrial plants. Back-trajectory analysis for strongly enhanced
  samples suggests long-range transport from tropical regions in Africa or
  South America, the proof of which requires a follow-on analysis with a global
  chemistry transport model.%

  The transport of biomass burning emissions from southern Africa to the
  neighboring Atlantic and Indian Oceans during the dry season (May-October) of
  2000 is characterized using ground, ozonesonde, and aircraft measurements of
  carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) in and around southern Africa, together
  with the GEOS-CHEM global model of tropospheric chemistry. The model shows a
  positive bias of approximately 20% for CO and a negative bias of
  approximately 10-25% for O3 at oceanic sites downwind of fire emissions. Near
  areas of active fire emissions the model shows a negative bias of
  approximately 60% and approximately 30% for CO and O3, respectively, likely
  due to the coarse spatial (2 deg. x 2.5 deg.) and temporal (monthly)
  resolution of the model compared to that of active fires. On average, from
  1994 to 2000, approximately 60 Tg of carbon monoxide (CO) from biomass
  burning in southern Africa was transported eastward to the Indian Ocean
  across the latitude band 0 deg. -60 S during the 6 months of the dry season.
  Over the same time period, approximately 40 Tg of CO from southern African
  biomass burning was transported westward to the Atlantic Ocean over the
  latitudes 0 deg. -20 S during the 6-month dry season, but most of that amount
  was transported back eastward over higher latitudes to the south (21 deg. -60
  S). Eastward transport of biomass burning emissions from southern Africa
  enhances CO concentrations by approximately 4- 13 ppbv per month over the
  southern subtropical Indian Ocean during the dry season, with peak
  enhancements in September. Carbon monoxide from southern African and South
  American biomass burning is seen in the model simulations as far away as
  Australia, contributing approximately 8 ppbv and approximately 12-15 ppbv CO,
  respectively, and thus explaining the approximately 20- 25 ppbv observed
  enhancement of CO over Melbourne in mid-September 2000.%

  Biomass burning is a major source of pollution in the tropical Southern
  Hemisphere, and fine mode carbonaceous particles are produced by the same
  combustion processes that emit carbon monoxide (CO). In this paper we examine
  these emissions with data from the Terra satellite, CO profiles from the
  Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument, and
  fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging
  Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The satellite measurements are used in conjunction
  with calculations from the MOZART chemical transport model to examine the
  2003 Southern Hemisphere burning season with particular emphasis on the
  months of peak fire activity in September and October. Pollutant emissions
  follow the occurrence of dry season fires, and the temporal variation and
  spatial distributions of MOPITT CO and MODIS AOD are similar. We examine the
  outflow from Africa and South America with emphasis on the impact of these
  emissions on clean remote regions. We present comparisons of MOPITT
  observations and ground-based interferometer data from Lauder, New Zealand,
  which indicate that intercontinental transport of biomass burning pollution
  from Africa often determines the local air quality. The correlation between
  enhancements of AOD and CO column for distinct biomass burning plumes is very
  good with correlation coefficients greater than 0.8. We present a method
  using MOPITT and MODIS data for estimating the emission ratio of aerosol
  number density to CO concentration which could prove useful as input to
  modeling studies. We also investigate decay of plumes from African fires
  following export into the Indian Ocean and compare the MOPITT and MODIS
  measurements as a way of estimating the regional aerosol lifetime. Vertical
  transport of biomass burning emissions is also examined using CO profile
  information. Low-altitude concentrations are very high close to source
  regions, but further downwind of the continents, vertical mixing takes place
  and results in more even CO vertical distributions. In regions of significant
  convection, particularly in the equatorial Indian Ocean, the CO mixing ratio
  is greater at higher altitudes, indicating vertical transport of biomass
  burning emissions to the upper troposphere.%

  We present a first description and evaluation of GEOS-CHEM, a global
  three-dimensional (3-D) model of tropospheric chemistry driven by assimilated
  meteorological observations from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) of
  the NASA Data Assimilation Office (DAO). The model is applied to a 1-year
  simulation of tropospheric ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon chemistry for 1994, and is
  evaluated with observations both for 1994 and for other years. It reproduces
  usually to within 10 ppb the concentrations of ozone observed from the
  worldwide ozonesonde data network. It simulates correctly the seasonal phases
  and amplitudes of ozone concentrations for different regions and altitudes,
  but tends to underestimate the seasonal amplitude at northern midlatitudes.
  Observed concentrations of NO and peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) observed in
  aircraft campaigns are generally reproduced to within a factor of 2 and often
  much better. Concentrations of HNO3 in the remote troposphere are
  overestimated typically by a factor of 2-3, a common problem in global models
  that may reflect a combination of insufficient precipitation scavenging and
  gas-aerosol partitioning not resolved by the model. The model yields an
  atmospheric lifetime of methylchloroform (proxy for global OH) of 5.1 years,
  as compared to a best estimate from observations of 5.5 plus or minus 0.8
  years, and simulates H2O2 concentrations observed from aircraft with
  significant regional disagreements but no global bias. The OH concentrations
  are approximately 20% higher than in our previous global 3-D model which
  included an UV-absorbing aerosol. Concentrations of CO tend to be
  underestimated by the model, often by 10-30 ppb, which could reflect a
  combination of excessive OH (a 20% decrease in model OH could be accommodated
  by the methylchloroform constraint) and an underestimate of CO sources
  (particularly biogenic). The model underestimates observed acetone
  concentrations over the South Pacific in fall by a factor of 3; a missing
  source from the ocean may be implicated.%

  Global chemistry-transport models (CTMs) typically use simplified
  parameterizations or relaxation to climatology to estimate the chemical
  behavior of the stratosphere only in the context of its impact on
  tropospheric chemistry. This limits investigation of stratospheric chemistry
  and interactions between tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry-transport
  processes. We incorporate stratospheric chemical and physical processes into
  the model GEOS-Chem in the form of a unified chemistry extension (UCX). The
  stratospheric chemistry framework from NASA's Global Modeling Initiative
  (GMI) is updated in accordance with JPL 10-06 and combined with GEOS-Chem's
  existing widely applied and validated tropospheric chemistry to form a
  single, unified gas-phase chemistry scheme. Aerosol calculations are extended
  to include heterogeneous halogen chemistry and the formation, sedimentation
  and evaporation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) as well as background
  liquid binary sulfate (LBS) aerosols. The Fast-JX v7.0a photolysis scheme
  replaces a hybrid of Fast-J and Fast-JX v6.2, allowing photolytic destruction
  at frequencies relevant to the stratosphere and of species not previously
  modeled. Finally, new boundary conditions are implemented to cover both
  surface emissions of new species and mesospheric behavior. Results for four
  simulation years (2004-2007) are compared to those from the original,
  tropospheric model and to in situ and satellite-based measurements. We use
  these comparisons to show that the extended model is capable of modeling
  stratospheric chemistry efficiently without compromising the accuracy of the
  model at lower altitudes, perturbing mean OH below 250hPa by less than 5%
  while successfully capturing stratospheric behavior not previously captured
  in GEOS-Chem such as formation and collapse of the Antarctic ozone hole.
  These extensions (with supporting validation and intercomparison) enable an
  existing and extensively validated tropospheric CTM to be used to investigate
  a broader set of atmospheric chemistry problems and leverages GEOS-Chem's
  existing tropospheric treatment. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.%

  The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1
  (MEGAN2.1) is a modeling framework for estimating fluxes of biogenic
  compounds between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere using simple
  mechanistic algorithms to account for the major known processes controlling
  biogenic emissions. It is available as an offline code and has also been
  coupled into land surface and atmospheric chemistry models. MEGAN2.1 is an
  update from the previous versions including MEGAN2.0, which was described for
  isoprene emissions by Guenther et al. (2006) and MEGAN2.02, which was
  described for monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions by Sakulyanontvittaya
  et al. (2008). Isoprene comprises about half of the total global biogenic
  volatile organic compound (BVOC) emission of 1 Pg (1000 Tg or 1015 g)
  estimated using MEGAN2.1. Methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone,
  alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, t-beta-ocimene, limonene, ethene, and propene
  together contribute another 30% of the MEGAN2.1 estimated emission. An
  additional 20 compounds (mostly terpenoids) are associated with the MEGAN2.1
  estimates of another 17% of the total emission with the remaining 3%
  distributed among >100 compounds. Emissions of 41 monoterpenes and 32
  sesquiterpenes together comprise about 15% and 3 %, respectively, of the
  estimated total global BVOC emission. Tropical trees cover about 18% of the
  global land surface and are estimated to be responsible for similar to 80% of
  terpenoid emissions and similar to 50% of other VOC emissions. Other trees
  cover about the same area but are estimated to contribute only about 10% of
  total emissions. The magnitude of the emissions estimated with MEGAN2.1 are
  within the range of estimates reported using other approaches and much of the
  differences between reported values can be attributed to land cover and
  meteorological driving variables. The offline version of MEGAN2.1 source code
  and driving variables is available from http://bai.acd.ucar.edu/MEGAN/ and
  the version integrated into the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) can be
  downloaded from http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/.%

  A biogenic emissions scheme has been incorpo-rated in the global dynamic
  vegetation model ORCHIDEE (Organizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic
  Ecosys-tEms) in order to calculate global biogenic emissions of isoprene,
  monoterpenes, methanol, acetone, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde and formic and
  acetic acids. Important param-eters such as the leaf area index are fully
  determined by the global vegetation model and the influences of light
  extinc-tion (for isoprene emissions) and leaf age (for isoprene and methanol
  emissions) are also taken into account. We study the interannual variability
  of biogenic emissions using the satellite-based climate forcing ISLSCP-II as
  well as relevant CO 2 atmospheric levels, for the 1983–1995 period. Mean
  global emissions of 460 TgC/yr for isoprene, 117 TgC/yr for monoterpenes, 106
  TgC/yr for methanol and 42 TgC/yr for acetone are predicted. The mean global
  emission of all bio-genic compounds is 752±16 TgC/yr with extremes ranging
  from 717 TgC/yr in 1986 to 778 TgC/yr in 1995, that is a 8.5% increase
  between both. This variability differs signif-icantly from one region to
  another and among the regions studied, biogenic emissions anomalies were the
  most vari-able in Europe and the least variable in Indonesia (isoprene and
  monoterpenes) and North America (methanol). Two sce-narios of land use
  changes are considered using the 1983 cli-mate and atmospheric CO 2
  conditions, to study the sensi-tivity of biogenic emissions to vegetation
  alteration, namely tropical deforestation and European afforestation. Global
  biogenic emissions are highly affected by tropical deforesta-tion, with a 29%
  decrease in isoprene emission and a 22% increase in methanol emission. Global
  emissions are not sig-nificantly affected by European afforestation, but on a
  Euro-pean scale, total biogenic VOCs emissions increase by 54%.%

  Eucalypts are among the highest emitters of biogenic volatile organic
  compounds, yet there is relatively little data available from field studies
  of this genus. Emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes and the short-chained
  carbonyls formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone were determined from four
  species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus grandis,
  and Eucalytpus viminalis) in Australia. A smaller comparative study was
  conducted on E. camaldulensis in south-eastern Australia. Carbonyl emissions,
  reported here for the first time from eucalypts, were generally comparable
  with rates reported for other species, with diurnal emissions peaking at
  about 4, 75 and 34??nmol??m-2??min-1 for acetone, formaldehyde and
  acetaldehyde respectively. There was wide variation in diurnal isoprene and
  monoterpene emissions between species, but under standard conditions,
  isoprene emissions were much lower than previous reports. Conversely,
  standard emission rates of monoterpenes were as much as six times greater
  than previous reports for some species. Emission of each carbonyl was
  correlated with its ambient concentration across different species, but more
  weakly related to temperature. Acetaldehyde emission in particular was
  significantly correlated with transpiration, but not with sap flow or with
  ethanol concentrations in xylem sap, suggesting fermentation within the leaf
  and stomatal conductance are primary controlling processes. Differences in
  acetaldehyde exchange velocities between sites, in addition to transpiration
  differences, suggest stomata may indeed exert long term emission regulation,
  in contrast to compounds for which no biological sink exists. ?? 2009

  This work presents global tropospheric formaldehyde columns retrieved from
  near-UV radiance measurements performed by the GOME instrument onboard ERS-2
  since 1995, and by SCIAMACHY, in operation on ENVISAT since the end of 2002.
  A special effort has been made to ensure the coherence and quality of the
  CH2O dataset covering the period 1996–2007. Optimised DOAS settings are
  proposed in order to reduce the impact of two important sources of error in
  the derivation of slant columns, namely, the polarisation anomaly affecting
  the SCIAMACHY spectra around 350 nm, and a major absorption band of the O4
  collision complex centred near 360 nm. The air mass factors are determined
  from scattering weights generated using radiative transfer calculations
  taking into account the cloud fraction, the cloud height and the ground
  albedo. Vertical profile shapes of CH2O are provided by the global CTM IMAGES
  based on an up-to-date representation of emissions, atmospheric transport and
  photochemistry. A comprehensive error analysis is presented. This includes
  errors on the slant columns retrieval and errors on the air mass factors
  which are mainly due to uncertainties in the a priori profile and in the
  cloud properties. The major features of the retrieved formaldehyde column
  distribution are discussed and compared with previous CH2O datasets over the
  major emission regions.%

  We describe a new global multiyear satellite fire product designed to meet
  the needs of the global modeling community. We use the new data set to
  analyze the global distribution of biomass burning using five different
  temporal metrics derived from 5 years of high-quality satellite data acquired
  with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), on board
  NASA's Terra satellite. The global distributions of fire pixel density, peak
  month, season length, and annual periodicity are described. As part of our
  analysis we show, for the first time, the global distribution of the fire
  radiative power (FRP), a relatively new remotely sensed quantity.We find that
  low FRP tends to be associated with areas of cropland burning. In the tropics
  and much of the subtropics, low FRP is also associated with more heavily
  forested areas, while higher FRP tends to occur in areas of grassland
  burning. In boreal forests this trend is reversed, with higher FRP occurring
  in areas of greater tree cover. We next combine 3 years of Terra and Aqua
  MODIS observations to show that a strong diurnal fire cycle is prevalent at
  tropical and subtropical latitudes. We also consider the consistency of the
  fire time series recorded by the two MODIS instruments, and find the month of
  peak burning and fire season length observed by each to be in good agreement
  in most areas. However, significant discrepancies with respect to seasonality
  do occur in some relatively small areas, and are most pronounced in tropical
  rain forest.%

  Large quantities of non-methane organic compounds are emitted into the
  atmosphere from biogenic sources, mainly from vegetation. These organic
  compounds include isoprene, C10H16 monoterpenes, C 15H24 sesquiterpenes, and
  a number of oxygenated compounds including methanol, hexene derivatives,
  2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. In the troposphere these
  organic compounds react with hydroxyl (OH) radicals, nitrate (NO3) radicals
  and ozone (O 3), and play an important role in the chemistry of the lower
  troposphere. In this article the kinetics, products and mechanisms of the
  tropospheric reactions of biogenic organic compounds are presented and
  briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The ozonolyses of six monoterpenes (a-pinene, b-pinene, 3-carene,
  terpinolene, a-terpinene, and myrcene), two sesquiterpenes (a-humulene and
  b-caryophyllene), and two oxygenated terpenes (methyl chavicol and linalool)
  were conducted individually in Teflon chambers to examine the gas-phase
  oxidation product and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields from these
  reactions. Particle size distribution and number concentration were monitored
  and allowed for the calculation of the SOAyield from each experiment, which
  ranged from 1 to 54%. A proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS)
  was used to monitor the evolution of gas-phase products, identified by their
  mass to charge ratio (m/z). Several gas-phase oxidation products,
  formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formic acid, acetone, acetic acid, and nopinone,
  were identified and calibrated. Aerosol yields, and the yields of these
  identified and calibrated oxidation products, as well as many higher m/z
  oxidation products observed with the PTR-MS, varied significantly between the
  different parent terpene compounds. The sum of measured oxidation products in
  the gas and particle phase ranged from 33 to 77% of the carbon in the reacted
  terpenes, suggesting there are still unmeasured products from these
  reactions. The observations of the higher molecular weight oxidation product
  ions provide evidence of previously unreported compounds and their temporal
  evolution in the smog chamber from multistep oxidation processes. Many of the
  observed ions, including m/z 111 and 113, have also been observed in ambient
  air above a Ponderosa pine forest canopy, and our results confirm they are
  consistent with products from terpene + O3 reactions. Many of these products
  are stable on the timescale of our experiments and can therefore be monitored
  in field campaigns as evidence for ozone oxidative chemistry. Citation:%
