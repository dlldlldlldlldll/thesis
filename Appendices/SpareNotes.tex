    \cite{Patchen2007} examine the branching step where isoprene either forms ROO or RONO$_2$, and for specific conditions they determine the reaction rates for each branch.
    They find the most frequent pathway is the formation of ROO (99.3\%).
    Although the nitrates formation is relatively infrequent, this pathway can lead to NO$_X$ transport into clean environments (\cite{Horowitz1998}).
    This transport can be exacerbated by fast winds and low OH concentrations, making nitrates an important factor in modelling atmospheric chemistry.
    
    PAN has a relatively long lifetime (against OH, order of 1 day) and is able to transport and release the NO$_X$ in environments which are quite far from any emissions.
