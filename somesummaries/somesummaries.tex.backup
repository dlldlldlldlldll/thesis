\section{VOCs}
  \subsection{Gloudemans 2006: Validation of OMI, GOME-2A and GOME-2B tropospheric NO$_2$, SO$_2$ and HCHO products using MAX-DOAS observations from 2011 to 2014 in Wuxi, China}
    \citet{Gloudemans2006}
    
    Recalculating the AMFs using the MAX-DOAS apriori improves the correlation between MAX-DOAS tropospheric vertical column density (VCD) and the satellite VCD (by 35\% for HCHO). 
    OMI VCDs are underestimated by $\sim20$\% at Wuxi, China (a few hours north west from Shanghai).
    
    AMFs are mainly affected by relative vertical distributions of aerosols and trace gases (TGs).
    
    
  \subsection{Yue 2015: Distinguishing the drivers of trends in land carbon fluxes and plant
volatile emissions over the past 3 decades}
    \citet{Yue2015}
    Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere (YIBs) model driven by ECMWF used to study global trends of land carbon fluxes and BVOC emissions from 1982-2011.
    MODIS and NDVI-GIMMS are used to determine LAI, with isoprene emissions driven by two seperate datasets in order to test isoprene driving sensitivity.
    One isoprene scheme is MEGAN, the other is a photosynthesis dependent model.
    
    Drivers of trends in GPP, NPP, NEP, BVOC emissions, etc.. are determined through running the model with various parameters set to repeat the 1980 data.
    Differences from the control run show how sensitive the changes are to changes in the parameters.
    trends WERE sensitive to the use of MEGAN vs the use of the photosynthesis driven model.
    
    Understanding the drivers of trends in biogenic volatile organic compound emissions is needed in order to estimate future carbon fluxes, changes in the water cycle, air quality, and other climate responses.
    Changes in growing and dying season for plants drives some of the isoprene emissions trends.
    
    Global increases of carbon uptake from 1982-2011, especially for tropical areas, largely due to CO$_2$ fertilisation.
    
    ``The terrestrial biosphere interacts with the atmosphere through photosynthesis and biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions. Annually, terrestrial ecosystems assimilate ∼ 120 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) from the atmosphere (Beer et al., 2010), most of which reenters atmosphere through respiration and decomposition, resulting in a net global land carbon sink of 2.6 ± 0.7 Pg C a −1 (Le Quèrè et al., 2009; Sitch et al., 2015''

\section{Ozone}
  \subsection{Borchi 2007:}


  \subsection{Liu 2015: Origins of tropospheric ozone interannual variation over Réunion: A model investigation}
    \citet{Liu2015}:
    Ozonesondes released at reunion island as part of SHADOZ(\url{http://croc.gsfc.nasa.gov/shadoz/}) are analysed against GMI-CTM grid box profiles matching sonde release dates.
    50\% increase in tropospheric ozone from 1992 - 2011 in JJA months based on ozonesonde measurements.
    ``Far fewer studies have focused on the long-term behaviour of ozone in the Southern Hemisphere owing to a lack of suitable observations.''
    Sparse sampling does not fully capture Interannual Variability (IAV) in the upper troposphere shown by the model.
    
    Stratospheric influence over Reunion of the tropospheric ozone is important, although model resolution and sonde sparcity make analysis more difficult.
    ``Increasing emission over southern Africa appear to affect only the lower troposphere'', with an increasing trend in the middle and upper troposphere during austral winter left unexplained.
    The widening tropical belt may also be increasing the stratospheric influence over Reunion.

  \subsection{Mze 2010:}
    \citet{Mze2010}
    ``The tropical stratosphere is, however, a zone where it is difficult to measure ozone by satellite experiments, due to increased Rayleigh atmospheric attenuation, high altitude clouds, low temperature, high humidity and dense aerosols (Borchi et al., 2007)''.
