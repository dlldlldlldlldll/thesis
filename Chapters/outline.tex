\chapter{Outline}

  \section{Overview}
    In this thesis I will combine satellite and ground based atmospheric measurements with chemical transport modelling to clarify the impact of Australian natural emissions on atmospheric composition and chemistry.
    This broadly includes O$_3$, NO$_X$, VOCs, HO$_X$, and the various processes which influence their composition and transport.
    A review of the literature on several topics is included with a view to touch on all the possible factors affecting my own work.
    This leads into my first chapter: ``Stratosphere to Troposphere Transport of ozone''.
    
    My second chapter is 
  \section{Lit review}
    Ozone and ozone precursors, along with the toxic effects and future projections of tropospheric ozone.
    Satellite measurements of HCHO, calculations of VOC emissions, GOES-Chem and MEGAN model histories, HCHO and VOC atmospheric distributions, variations, and chemistry.
  
  \section{Ozone}
      Here I analyse a dataset of ozonesondes, and calculate how many STTs occur in the high southern latitudes.
      GEOS-Chem is used to estimate how much tropospheric ozone is due to these STT events.
      
      These processes are some portion of the tropospheric ozone source - ties into another source: VOCs
