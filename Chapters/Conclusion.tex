\label{Conclusions:aims}

  
  % The two largest contributors to tropospheric ozone concentrations are chemical production (driven by precursor emissions) and stratospheric transport.
  % I aim to improve understanding of both of these sources using existing satellite and ground-based datasets along with GEOS-Chem modelled outputs.
  \textbf{In this thesis I aim to improve understanding of natural contributions to ozone over Australia and the southern ocean.}
  Chapter \ref{LR} examines processes leading to ozone creation in the troposphere, primarily starting with isoprene emissions.
  Processes involved after emissions are explained and a summary of how the lack of information available over Australia affects modelling and forecasting is provided.
  The secondary cause of ozone, stratosphere to troposphere transport (STT), is also outlined with associated processes and causes discussed.
  Chapter \fullref{BioIsop} shows how models are misrepresenting isoprene emissions by a large margin in Australia, along with the description and implementation of a relatively simple method of improvement.
  Chapter \fullref{Ozone} provides an estimate of stratospheric ozone influx to the troposphere, along with potential classifications and seasonality.
  
  
  
  % % Aim for Chapter 2: Modelling examination
  % Estimation of BVOC emissions in Australia can be improved through satellite measurements of one of the primary oxidation products HCHO.
  % Satellites which overpass daily record reflected solar (and emitted terrestrial) radiation, and give us measurements over all of Australia.
  % Combining satellite data with model outcomes provides a platform for the understanding of natural processes, which are uncertain over Australia.
  % Satellite measurements use modelled a priori vertical profiles of HCHO to estimate total column amounts.
  \textbf{I aim to recalculate satellite vertical columns of HCHO using updated model a priori information.}
  % In this effort I aim to improving the understanding of the importance of relevant parameters (within GEOS-Chem) in calculating vertical columns of HCHO measured by satellite.
  % This includes an examination of how well GEOS-Chem simulates several species such as NO$_X$, isoprene, and HCHO compared to both in-situ and remote measurement data that exists for Australia.
  % Additionally I detail the construction and effects of satellite data filters.
  % The work towawrds this aim is in Chapter \ref{Model}.
  % %Soil moisture plays an important role in VOC emissions, as trees under stress may stop emitting various chemicals. 
  % %This is especially true for Australia due to frequent droughts and wildfires.
  % %The argument for improved understanding of land surface properties, specifically soil moisture, is an old one\parencite{Mintz1982, Rowntree1983, Chen2001}.
  HCHO from OMI on board the AURA satellite (see Section \ref{Model:omhcho}) is read pixel by pixel and examined in Chapter \ref{Model}, where influence of the air mass factor (AMF) is discussed in detail (Section \ref{Model:AMF}).
  This AMF was created using an older version of GEOS-Chem with out-of-date HCHO chemistry.
  Recalculation, binning, and analysis of the satellite HCHO vertical columns is performed using GEOS-Chem v10.01, outlined in Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc:outline}.
  This is performed using my own partial AMF recalculation code, along with full recalculation code set up in collaboration with Prof. Palmer and Dr. Surl.
  Subsequent use of the data makes further use of the recalculation as a basic sensitivity analysis of top-down emissions estimations to apriori satellite information.
   
  % % Aim for Chapter 3: Biogenic emissions estimation
  % The technique of determining isoprene emissions from satellite detected HCHO is called satellite inversion.
  \textbf{I aim to determine biogenic isoprene emissions in Australia using a top-down inversion of satellite HCHO, through an estimated yield from GEOS-Chem.}
  % Hcho amounts and the yield of isoprene to HCHO over Australia is required to create top-down estimates.
  % This process also requires careful examination of when the assumptions required within the inversion process are not valid.
  % Due to the low availability of in-situ data over most of the Australian continent, a combination of modelled and satellite data could reduce the uncertainties of isoprene emissions from Australian landscapes.
  % Improved emissions estimates will in turn improve the accuracy of CTMs, providing better predictions of atmospheric composition and its response to ongoing environmental change.
  % The work towards fulfilling this aim is in Chapter \ref{BioIsop}.
  In Chapter \ref{BioIsop} I determine the linear relationship between total column HCHO and biogenic isoprene emissions over Australia using the global CTM GEOS-Chem.
  Applying this relationship to satellite based HCHO measurements creates the desired top-down isoprene emissions estimate.
  This process is described in Section \ref{BioIsop:method}, and requires intensive filtering of both satellite data (to exclude non-biogenic HCHO sources) and model yield (to minimise spatial smearing).
  The uncertainty and limitations of top-down estimates due to satellite and model uncertainty, along with temporal and horizontal resolution of available data is examined in Section \ref{BioIsop:uncertainty}.
  Furthermore, this top-down estimation is used to scale a new simulation of HCHO, and O$_3$ over Australia, described in Section \ref{BioIsop:method:scaled}.
   
  % % Aim for Chapter 4: STT Ozone
  \textbf{To improve understanding of ozone transported to the troposphere from the stratosphere in Australia and the southern ocean.}
  % Stratospheric transport is the second largest driver of tropospheric ozone concentrations, and an improved understanding of transported ozone can be determined from ozonesonde measurements.
  % Ozonesondes provide a glimpse of the vertical ozone profile up to $\sim 30$~km, and we use a Fourier filter to determine how often stratospheric transport is occurring at three sites: Melbourne, Macquarie Island, and Davis Station. 
  % Combining transport event frequency analysis with modelled ozone distributions is used to derive a new method of detection and quantification of transported ozone in Chapter \ref{Ozone}.
  In Chapter \ref{Ozone} the seasonal cycle of STT events is characterised, and their contribution to the SH extra-tropical tropospheric ozone budget is quantified using GEOS-Chem to estimate ozone flux extrapolated from three measurement sites.
  Causal climatology and event seasonality are examined in Section \ref{Ozone:eventclimatologies}.
  Section \ref{Ozone:STTevents} uses STT detection frequencies and modelled tropospheric ozone columns to estimate STT ozone flux near three sites. 
  Findings are compared against relevant literature, and (in Section \ref{Ozone:sensitivity}) the uncertainties involved in STT event detection ozone flux estimation is studied.

  % % Chapter 5: Conclusions?
  % \textbf{I aim to describe relative importance of sources of tropospheric ozone in Australia, as well as seasonality.}
  % I will describe how modelled ozone is affected by updated isoprene emissions, comparing changes in GEOS-Chem outputs.
  % Trends of isoprene emissions and their relationship to tropospheric ozone trends could provide new insight into the future of tropospheric ozone in Australia.

\section{Ozone over Australia}
\label{Conclusions:ozone}
  
  Ozone production in the troposphere is a complex process involving various compounds.
  Tropospheric ozone is enhanced through VOC chemistry, stratospheric transport, and pollution, of which the first two are highly uncertain.
  Of these ozone sources, VOC chemistry uncertainty is dominated by a lack of understanding of biogenic emissions (mainly) of isoprene.
  BVOC emissions of isoprene are globally modelled at $\sim$465-500\tgcpyr \parencite{Guenther2006, Messina2016}. 
  However these appear to be overestimated in Australia, as seen here with top-down estimates at $\sim 19$ \tgcpyr compared to $\sim 43$ \tgcpyr using GEOS-Chem (which implements MEGAN).
  Figure TODO shows how isoprene emissions regionally compare between GEOS-Chem and the new top-down estimate.
  
  TODO: ozone concentrations using emissions from MEGAN/TOP-Down, also how these compare to estimated STT:
  Ozone production in the tropospheric is estimated using the global CTM GEOS-Chem before and after scaling isoprene emissions based on top-down satellite data. 
  The results are tabulated for each of five regions, and all of Australia, and shown here in Table \ref{Conclusions:ozone:tab_emissions_vs_ozone}.
  The reduction in isoprene emissions does not have much impact on modelled ozone, with each region experiencing $< 1\%$ reduction in tropospheric column ozone even though isoprene emissions are halved on average over Australia.
  TODO: discuss: In contrast to the south eastern region, where an XX\% ozone change is observed, STT analysis over Melbourne suggests up to YY\% of the tropospheric column is due to stratospheric influx.
  This table also shows the change in isoprene emissions scaling, which shows us that a XX\% change causes YY\% reduced ozone concentration.

  TODO: how isoprene is linked to ozone in modelling 
  Figure \ref{Conclusions:ozone:new_emiss_series} shows surface level (up to $\sim 150$~m altitude) ozone concentration over 2005 before and after scaling modelled isoprene emissions.
  Reducing isoprene emissions lowers surface ozone concentrations by TODO: XX to YY \%.
  The direct correlation between reduced emissions and surface ozone (Figure TODO) is more or less clear monthly, and using multiple years enhances/reduces the relationship.

\section{Potential future work}
\label{Conclusions:future}
  
  % Soil moisture improvement
  One of the important parameters in Australia is the soil moisture activity factor($\gamma_{SM}$), which can have large regional effects on the isoprene emissions \parencite{Sindelarova2014,Bauwens2016}.
  Generally if soil moisture is too low, isoprene emissions stop \parencite{Pegoraro2004,Niinemets2010}, however in many Australian regions the plants may be more adapted to lower moisture levels. (TODO: Find cites for this - talk from K Emerson at Stanley indicated this)
  GEOS-Chem runs MEGANv2.1, which has three possible states for isoprene emissions based on the soil moisture ($\theta$):
  \begin{align*}
  \gamma_\mathrm{SM} & = 1 && \theta > \theta_1 \\
  \gamma_\mathrm{SM} & = (\theta-\theta_w)/\Delta\theta_1  && \theta_w < \theta < \theta_1 \\
  \gamma_\mathrm{SM} & = 0 && \theta < \theta_w \\
  \end{align*}
  where $\theta_w$ is the wilting point, and $\theta_1$ determines when plants are near the wilting point.
  The wilting point is set by a land based database from \textcite{Chen2001}, while $\theta_1$ is set globally based on \textcite{Pegoraro2004}.
  These moisture states are disabled in GEOS-Chem V10.01.
  Improved isoprene emissions modelling requires this soil moisture problem to be handled.
  Simply enabling the parameter in its current form is not quite good enough for Australia, due to both the unknown soil moisture and the poorly understood plant responses in this country.
  TODO: cite the paper which could update MEGAN soil moisture parameterisation.
  
  Using satellite data to improve isoprene emission estimates such as done in this thesis must be used to analyse model improvements, since fully independent measurements are lacking.
  Measurements of isoprene emissions in Australia would provide a valuable opportunity to verify improvements in emission estimates.
  Emissions measurement would be greatly valuable however they remain expensive and difficult, especially over the large sparse environment which makes up the Australia outback.
