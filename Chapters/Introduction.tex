  One important aspect of the air is ozone, which has impacts on RF, health, crop-yields, etc...
  TODO: take some of o3 paper intro and throw here.
\section{Ozone}
\label{LR:O3}
  %TODO What is ozone
  Ozone (O3) is a toxic greenhouse gas, which is abundant and useful up in the stratosphere.
  
  %TODO Structure of ozone layer chapman eqn etc.
  
  % TODO things that affect ozone concentrations 
    Stratosphere to Troposphere
    Production from precursors: NOx and VOCs
    
    Of these precursors VOCs are less well understood, especially in Australia where emissions are largely extrapolated and uncertain.

\section{VOCs}
\label{LR:VOCs}
    %What they are
    
    \subsection{Emissions}
    Other impacts (AQ, Oxidation)
    How measured (directly, inversions)
    
\section{HCHO}
\label{LR:HCHO}
  % What is HCHO:
    Sources
    How measured (in-situ, satellite)
