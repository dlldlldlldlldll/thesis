\section{The atmosphere}
\label{LR:Atmos}
  % Overarching description of atmosphere
  The atmosphere is made up of various gases held to the earths surface by gravity. 
  These gases undergo transport on all scales, from barbeque smoke being blown into your face to smoke plumes from forest fires travelling accross the world and depositing in the antarctic snow.
  They take part in various chemical reactions along the way, largely driven by solar input and interactions with eachother.
  Various chemicals are lofted into the atmosphere by soil, trees, factories, cars, seas and oceans, you name it.
  They are also deposited back to the surface both directly and in rain drops.
  
  % Air
  Mostly the atmosphere is made up of nitrogen (N$_2$: $\sim 78\%$), oxygen (O$_2$: $\sim 21\%$), and argon (Ar: $\sim 1\%$).
  Water (H$_2$O) ranges from $0.001$ to $1\%$ depending on evaporation and precipitation.
  Beyond these major constituents the atmosphere has a vast number of \textit{trace gases}, including carbon dioxide (CO$_2$: $\sim 0.4\%$), Ozone (O$_3$: $.000001$ to $0.001\%$), and methane (CH$_4$: $\sim 0.4\%$) \cite[][Ch. 2]{BrasseurJacob2017}.
  Trace gases in the atmosphere can have a large impact on living conditions.
  They react in complex ways with other elements (anthropogenic and natural), affecting various ecosystems upon which life depends.
  
  % TODO: Pressure
  Most of the atmosphere ($\sim 85\%$) is within 10~km of the earths surface.
  This is due to air pressure, which decreases logarithmically with altitude.

    % Oxidation and Radicals
    \subsubsection{Hydroxyl radicals}
    The OH radical drives many processes in the atmosphere, especially during the day when photolysis of ozone drives OH concentrations \citep{Atkinson2000}.    
    OH is a key species which reacts with nearly all the organic compounds in the troposphere.
    The exceptions are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and Halons not containing H atoms \citep{Atkinson2000}.
    OH and HO$_2$ concentrations largely determine the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere.
    Oxidation and photolysis are the two main processes through which VOCs are broken down into HCHO, O$_3$, CO$_2$ and various other species.
    Over land, isoprene (C$_5$H$_8$) and monoterpenes (C$_10$H$_16$) account for 50\% and 30\% of the OH reactivity respectively \citep{Fuentes2000}.
    
    In the late 90's it was thought that OH radicals are formed exclusively from photolysis of O$_3$, HONO, HCHO, and other carbonyls (R$_2$C=O) \cite{Atkinson2000}.
    Isoprene (C$_5$H$_8$) was thought to be a sink of OH until it was shown by \cite{Paulot2009b} that the radicals are recycled.
    This recycling process is discussed in more detail in section \ref{LR:VOCs:IsopCascade}.
    
    Ozone is an important precursor to HO, as excited oxygen atoms (O(${}^1$D) are created through photolysis, which then go on to mix with water and form OH, as shown in this equation taken from \cite{Atkinson2000}:
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    O_3 + \text{hv}         & \to  O_2 + O({}^1D)   && (\lambda \le 335 \text{nm}) \\%
    O({}^1D) + M            & \to  O({}^3P) + M     && (M=N_2, O_2)               \\%
    O({}^3P) + O_2 + M      & \to  O_3 + M          && (M=\text{air})             \\%
    O({}^1D) + H_2O         & \to  2OH              &&                            \\%
    \end{aligned}
    \label{LR:Radicals:eqn_O3toOH}
    \end{equation}
    This shows how some of the O$({}^1D)$ recycles back to Ozone, while some forms OH.
    NB: The wavelength was updated to 350~nm in \cite{AtkinsonArey2003}.
    
    % Photolysis stuff
    Ozone is also a very important substance for formation of radicals (NO$_3$, OH) in the troposphere through photolysis in the presence of water.
    
    \subsubsection{Nitrate radicals}
    Nitrate radicals NO$_3$ are largely formed through ozone reactions.
    They are photolysed very rapidly during they day, with a lifetime of about 5~s \citep{Atkinson2000}.
    If NO and O$_3$ are both in the atmosphere, the following reactions \citep{Atkinson2000} occur:
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    NO + O_3         & \to NO_2 + O_2      && \\%
    NO_2 + O_3       & \to NO_3 + O_2      && \\%
    NO_3 + \text{hv} & \to NO + O_2        && (\sim 10\%)  \\%
    NO_3 + \text{hv} & \to NO_2 + O({}^3P) && (\sim 90\%)  \\%
    \end{aligned}
    \label{LR:Radicals:eqn_O3toNO2}
    \end{equation}
    A build up of NO$_3$ radicals can be seen at night, when photolysis is not removing them quickly \citep{Atkinson2000,Brown2009}.
    
    Since radicals play such a big role in regulating many chemical reactions in the atmosphere it's important for models to accurately represent them (eg. \cite{Travis2014}). 
    This is difficult as they are coupled with so many other species and measurements of OH are not readily available on a global scale.
    
    
    % Ozone lead in
    Ozone in the lower atmosphere is a serious hazard that causes health problems \citep{Hsieh2013}, damages agricultural crops worth billions of dollars \citep{Avnery2011,Yue2017}, and increases the rate of climate warming \citep{IPCC_2013_chap8}.

\section{Ozone}
\label{LR:O3}
  %TODO What is ozone
  Ozone (O$_3$) is mostly located in the stratosphere, where it helpfully prevents much of the shorter wave length solar radiation from reaching the earth's surface (ie UV light).
  However around 11\% of the total column of ozone is located in the troposphere (TODO: cite), where it has several deleterious effects.
  Around 5 to 20 percent of all air pollution related deaths are due to ozone (\cite{Monks2015}).
  In the short term, ozone concentrations of $\sim$50-60~ppbv over eight hours or $\sim$80~ppbv over one hour are agreed to constitude a human health hazard \citep{Ayers2006,Lelieveld2009}. 
  Long term exposure to lower levels cause problems with crop loss and ecosystem damage \citep{Emberson2003}, and both short and long term concentrations may get worse in the future \citep{Lelieveld2009, Stevenson2013}.
  Further tropospheric ozone enhancements are projected to drive reductions in global crop yields equivalent to losses of up to \$USD$_{2000}$ 35 billion per year by 2030 \citep{Avnery2011}, along with detrimental health outcomes equivalent to $\sim$\$USD$_{2000}$11.8 billion per year by 2050 \citep{Selin2009}.
  Recently \cite{Yue2017} showed that the net effect of near-surface ozone on is a $\sim 14\%$ decrease in net primary productivity (NPP) in China, which could be reduced by $\sim 70\%$ with drastic measures by 2030.
  
  %Structure of ozone layer chapman eqn etc.
  In the stratosphere ozone production is generally driven by the Chapman mechanism, as high energy light (with wavelengths $\lambda<242$~nm) photolyses the molecular oxygen (O$_2$) in the atmosphere \citep[][Chapter 3, section 2]{BrasseurJacob2017}.
  The Chapman mechanism involves several equations which lead to rough equilibrium of O, O$_2$, O$_3$ and pressure, as follows:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \label{LR:O3:eqn_Chapman}
    \textrm{O}_2 + hv(\lambda < 242 \text{nm}) & \rightarrow & \text{O} + \text{O} \\
    \text{O} + \text{O}_2 + \text{M} & \rightarrow & \text{O}_3 + \text{M} \\
    \text{O}_3 + hv(\lambda < 1180 \text{nm}) & \rightarrow & \text{O} + \text{O}_2 \\
    \text{O} + \text{O}_3 & \rightarrow & \text{O}_2 + \text{O}_2 \\
  \end{eqnarray*}
  Where $hv$ represents radiation and M is an inert molecule (such as N$_2$).
  The high energy photons ($\lambda < 242$~nm) are present from the top of the atmosphere but are mostly removed before reaching the troposphere.
  The lifetime of O against loss by O$_2$ is less than a second in the troposphere, and produced O$_3$ quickly returns to O and O$_2$, as low energy ($\lambda < 1180$~nm) light and M are abundant.
  The gradient of light penetration in addition to the logarithmic decrease in atmospheric pressure (which affects M abundance) drives (using the Chapman equation) the vertical profile of ozone into what is called the ozone layer, where most of the ozone is in the stratosphere.
  This mechanism requires radiation so only takes place during the daytime, during the night there are different processes driving ozone chemistry.
  
  % TODO things that affect ozone concentrations 
  Smoke plumes from biomass burning can carry ozone precursors, creating higher ozone concentrations downwind of the plume's source.
  Fire emissions include a range of chemicals and each year the affects of fire or burning seasons blanket the northern and southern hemispheres independently.
  
  TODO: get access to Hegglin (\url{10.1038/ngeo604}) \citep{Hegglin2009}
  
  % Measurements
  Since the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was established in August 1987, and ratified in August 1989, several satellites and many measurement stations were set up to monitor ozone in the stratosphere.
  However, in the southern hemisphere there are relatively few records of ozone (\cite{Huang2017}).
  One method of measuring ozone in the troposphere and stratosphere is by releasing weather balloons (with attached ozone detectors) which take readings as they rise up to around 30~km, giving a vertical profile of concentrations.
  Since 1986, Lauder, New Zealand (45$^{\circ}$S, 170$^{\circ}$E) has released ozonesondes allowing a multi-decadal analysis of ozone concentrations over the city \citep{Brinksma2002}.
  Kerguelan Island (49.2$^{\circ}$S, 70.1$^{\circ}$E), also has a record of ozonesonde profiles, which are directly in the path of biomass burning smoke plumes transported off shore from Africa \citep{Baray2012}.
  SHADOZ is the southern hemispheric additional ozone project, which have released sondes from 15 sites at different times \url{http://tropo.gsfc.nasa.gov/shadoz/}.
  
  What drives ozone in the troposphere? Two main contributors are transport from the stratosphere and creation due to biogenic emissions of precursors. 
  At smaller (regional) scales anthropogenic emissions are also important, especially in large cities such as Sydney due to NO$_X$ emissions from traffic and power production.
  
  \subsection{Stratosphere to troposphere transport}
    \label{LR:O3:STT}
    %% STT
    Historically (in the late 1990's), ozone transported down from the stratosphere was thought to contribute 10-40~ppb to tropospheric ozone levels, matching tropospheric production \citep{Atkinson2000, Stohl2003}.
    This number was revised down over the years as measurement and modelling campaigns improved our understanding of global scale transport, mixing, and chemistry \citep{Monks2015}.
    Recently \cite{Kuang2017} analysed various measurements in south-east USA and observed STT influence which can be seen to affect surface ozone levels.
    In their work they use high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL), ozonesondes, ozone lidar, and airborn in-situ measurements give the structure and temporal evolution of ozone and the low front weather system.
    
    Ozone transported to the troposphere from the stratosphere can occur through diffusion (slow process (TODO: Cite)) or through mixing, often called Stratosphere to Troposphere Transport events (STT), or intrusions.
    TODO: compare these two processes and their impacts briefly.
    Recently global chemical transport models (CTMs) have been used to trace how much ozone is being transported to the troposphere from the stratosphere.
    There are a few methods of doing this, such as \cite{Ojha2016}, who use the ECHAM5 CTM with a tracer that keeps track of ozone formed and transported from the stratosphere.
    Model based estimates generally require validation against actual measurements, such as those from ozonesondes or satellites.
    %Hegglin, M. I., and T. G. Shepherd (2009), Large climate-induced changes in ultraviolet index and stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux, Nature Geosci, 2(10), 687 \selectlanguage{english}691, doi:10.1038/NGEO604.
    \cite{Hegglin2009} estimate that climate change will lead to increased STT due to an acceleration in the Brewer Dobson circulation.
    They estimate $\sim 30$, and $\sim 121$~Tg yr$^{-1}$ increases (relative to 1965) in the southern and northern hemispheres respectively
    
    \cite{Liu2017} examine southern hemispheric ozone and the processes which control its inter-annual variability (IAV).
    IAV is the standard deviation of ozone anomalies (difference from the monthly mean).
    They show that ozone transported from the stratosphere plays a major role in the upper troposphere, especially over the southern Indian ocean during austral winter.
    While stratospheric transport mostly impacts the upper troposphere, some areas are impacted right down to the surface.
    \cite{Liu2017} look at modelled tropospheric ozone sensitivity to changes in stratospheric ozone, ozone precursor emissions, and lightning over the southern hemisphere from 1992--2011. 
    Their work suggest ozone at 430~hPa is mostly stratospheric in September over 20$^{\circ}$S to 60$^{\circ}$S at all longitudes.
    They also see tropospheric ozone sensitivity to emissions from South America (0--20$^{\circ}$S, 72.5--37.5$^{\circ}$W), southern Africa (5--10$^{\circ}$S, 12-38$^{\circ}$E), and South to South-east Asia (70-125$^{\circ}$E, 10$^{\circ}$S--40$^{\circ}$N).
    In the USA recent work by \cite{Lin2015} suggests that intrusions during spring are increasing surface ozone levels.
    Their work also recommends that understanding of frequency and cause of STT needs to be improved to effectively implement air quality standards.
    
    %Lead in to chem production
    An analysis of the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Inter-comparison Project (ACCMIP) simulations by \cite{Young2013} found STT is responsible for $540\pm140$~Tg yr$^{-1}$, equivalent to $\sim$11\% of the tropospheric ozone column, with the remainder produced photochemically \citep{Monks2015}.
  
  \subsection{Chemical production}
    The tropospheric ozone concentrations rely on climate and ozone precursor emissions; including NO, NO$_2$, CO, VOCs, and HCHO \citep{Atkinson2000, Young2013, Marvin2017}. 
    Ozone predictions are uncertain and difficult due to the vagaries of changing climate which affects both transport, deposition, destruction, and plant based precursor emissions.
    All of these processes are tightly coupled and difficult to accurately model, as they depend on uncertain assumptions such as CO$_2$ dependency \citep{Young2013}.
    Even with all the work done in the prior decades there remains large uncertainties about ozone precursors in the troposphere \citep{Mazzuca2016}.
    
    %% How VOCs and Ozone interact:
    Ozone is formed in the troposphere through oxidation of VOCs in the presence of NO$_X$.
    VOCs are described in the following section (Section \ref{LR:VOCs}).
    Net formation or loss of O$_3$ is determined by interactions between VOCs, NO$_X$, and HO$_X$, and is a complicated system of positive and negative feedbacks \citep{Atkinson2000}.
    Figure \ref{LR:VOCs:fig_NOXVOCOzone} shows the non-linear affect of NO$_X$ and VOC concentrations on ozone production over Houston, as modelled in \cite{Mazzuca2016}.
    Recently the relationship has been examined on the intradiel timescale showing that ozone production can be more or less sensitive to VOCs at different hours depending on location various other factors \citep{Mazzuca2016}.
    
    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{Figures/Mazzuca2016_NOxVOCOzone.png}
      \caption{Ozone production figure copied from \cite{Mazzuca2016}.}
      \label{LR:VOCs:fig_NOXVOCOzone}
    \end{figure}
    
    
    %TODO: formulae which regulate ozone levels 
    Ozone in rural areas is often higher than in populous cities, as the high NO levels titrate the O$_3$.
    Equation \ref{LR:Radicals:eqn_O3toNO2} shows how NO and O$_3$ lead to NO$_2$ and the very short lived NO$_3$ radical.
    
    % Loss pathways
    Tropospheric ozone is lost via chemical destruction and dry deposition, estimated to be $4700\pm700$ Tg yr$^{-1}$ and $1000\pm200$ Tg yr$^{-1}$, respectively \citep{Stevenson2006}.
    The main loss channel is through equation \ref{LR:Radicals:eqn_O3toOH}, where photolysis and pressure create OH from the O$_3$.
    

\section{VOCs}
\label{LR:VOCs}
  % What they are
  Organic compounds are members of a large class of chemicals whose molecules contain carbon, with the exception of a few compounds such as carbides, carbonates (CO$_3$), and simple oxides of carbon and cyanides.
  Organic compounds can be categorised based on their vapour pressure, which is the tendency of a liquid or solid to vaporise.
  Compounds with high vapour pressures at standard temperature are classed as volatile, and have a felicity to evaporate at low temperatures.
  Plants contain tens of thousands of organic compounds, it's likely that fewer than 40 are emitted due to the low volatility of most of them \citep{Guenther2000}.
  
  Atmospheric organic compounds are legion and differ by orders of magnitude with respect to their fundamental properties, such as volatility, reactivity, and cloud droplet formation propensity.
  Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have vapour pressure greater than $10^{-5}$~atm, and are mostly generated naturally by plants, which emit around 1000\tgpyr \citep{Guenther1995, Glasius2016}.
  Due to their high volatility these compounds are generally seen in the gas phase.
  Organic compounds with a lower volatility are classed as semi-volatile (SVOCs: vapour pressure between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-11}$~atm) are seen in both gas and particle phase depending on temperature and pressure.
  Organic compounds with even lower vapour pressure are generally found in the particle phase in aerosol particulate matter \citep{Glasius2016}.
  Understanding the drivers of trends in biogenic VOC emissions (BVOCs) is needed in order to estimate future carbon fluxes, changes in the water cycle, air quality, and other climate responses \citep{Yue2015}.
  

  %% What do VOCs do?
  VOCs are an important driver of atmospheric processes, especially near forests.
  VOC emissions result in radical cycling, acid deposition, production of tropospheric ozone, and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) \citep{Atkinson2000, Kanakidou2005}.
  A regional-model study in Europe (\cite{Aksoyoglu2017}) has also shown VOCs impact secondary inorganic aerosol concentrations.
  These have impacts on climate (through radiative forcing) and air quality, affecting both human health and crop yields \citep{IPCC_Chapter2, Avnery2011, Lelieveld2015}.
  
  % voc sources
  The major source of VOCs in the atmosphere is biogenic, with around 90\% of emissions (globally) coming from natural sources \citep{Guenther1995,Guenther2006, Millet2006}.
  Global non-methane VOC (NMVOC) levels are estimated at 85~\%, 13~\%, and 3~\% from biogenic, anthropogenic, and pyrogenic sources respectively \citep{Kefauver2014}.
  Methane and isoprene each comprise around a third of the global total emissions of VOCs (\cite{Guenther2006}).
  However, methane is relatively long lived (years) and is well mixed in the atmosphere while isoprene levels are very volatile and spatially diverse due to a life time of around an hour.
  This means that methane measurements and concentrations are relatively well understood, while NMVOCs are less so.
  
  % voc removals
  VOCs are removed by wet and dry deposition, OH oxidation, reaction with NO$_3$, ozonolysis (at night time or in polluted areas) or photolysis \citep{AtkinsonArey2003, Brown2009}.
  The process of deposition only accounts for a small fraction of the VOC loss, with the possible exception of the long lived methane compound \citep{AtkinsonArey2003}.
  
  % Impacts (AQ, Oxidation)
  %%% PM and SOA
  PM in the atmosphere is a major problem, causing an estimated 2-3 million deaths annually \citep{Hoek2013, Krewski2009, Silva2013, Lelieveld2015}. 
  Aerosols are suspended particulates and liquid compounds in the atmosphere, of which particulate matter (PM) is an important subset.
  Fine particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$) penetrates deep into the lungs and is detrimental to human health.
  Some PM comes from small organic aerosols (OA) emitted in the particulate phase and referred to as primary OA (POA).
  A substantial amount of PM is due to gaseous organic compounds transforming in the troposphere leading to what's known as secondary OA (SOA) \citep{Kroll2008}.
  
  Formation of SOA is generally due to VOC oxidation and subsequent reactions, while removal from the atmosphere is largely due to wet or dry deposition, and cloud scavenging \citep{Kanakidou2005}.
  It can be difficult to attribute PM formation, in part due to the complex relationship between NO$_X$, OH, O$_3$, and the uncertainty surrounding precursor emissions.
  
  
  %TODO: Isoprene subsection lead in
  
  
  \subsection{Isoprene}
  \label{LR:VOCs:Isop}
    Isoprene, or 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, is a VOC with the chemical formula C$_5$H$_8$. 
    It is of major importance to the atmosphere, as it is involved in various processes which alter the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere.
    NMVOCs are alkanes, alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons and isoprene, with isoprene being the most prominent.
    \cite{Guenther1995}, and subsequent updates \citep{Guenther2000,Guenther2006,Guenther2012}, have been used ubiquitously by the atmospheric community as a global estimate of isoprene emissions, at roughly 500-600\tgpyr, emitted mostly during the day.
    Recently an estimate of global isoprene emissions has been made using a completely different model, of around 465~Tg C yr$^{-1}$, by \cite{Messina2016} using ORCHIDEE.
    The global emission factors model used to derive both these estimates is based on modelling emissions from different plant species (phenotypes), and relatively few Australian species are used when forming in these estimates.
    
    Isoprene affects NO$_X$ and HO$_Y$ cycling, see for example formulae \ref{LR:Radicals:eqn_O3toOH}, \ref{LR:Radicals:eqn_O3toNO2}.
    In the presence of NO$_X$, isoprene forms tropospheric ozone and SOAs \citep{Wagner2002, Millet2006}.
    It has a short lifetime during the day, roughly an hour due to OH oxidation \citep{AtkinsonArey2003}).
    
    
    %% HOW its measured:
    Measurements of isoprene are often uncertain or difficult to make accurately.
    \cite{Kanakidou2005} summarised how chamber experiments used to measure isoprene reactions may be unsuitable for comparison to the natural atmosphere.
    In \cite{Nguyen2014} many scientists and groups worked together on chamber measurements, to improve understanding of ambient atmospheric oxidation mechanisms of biogenic hydrocarbons (such as isoprene).
    %% CHAMBER study examples?
    
    % Lead in to emissions
    Major emitters are tropical broadleafs (notably eucalypts), and scrubs \citep{Guenther2006, Arneth2008, Niinemets2010, Monks2015}.
    %% ESTIMATES
    It used to be thought that emissions of anthropogenic and biogenic VOCs (AVOCs, BVOCs respectively) were roughly similar (\cite{Muller1992}, TODO: more cites).
    Methane (CH$_4$) is one of the more abundant and potent VOCs, however it is often classified separately and compared against non-methane VOCs (NMVOCs).
    In the 1990's it became clear that biogenic emissions of VOCs were in fact dominant, although methane emissions are still largely anthropogenic. 
    
    
  \subsection{Emissions}
  \label{LR:VOCs:Emissions}
    Isoprene emissions are often classified as either anthropogenic, biogenic, or pyrogenic.
    The natural or biogenic sources are roughly ten times higher than the anthropogenic VOC sources \citep{Guenther2006, Kanakidou2005}.
    BVOC emissions make up 87\% of NMVOC emissions \citep{Kanakidou2005, Kefauver2014}.
    
    The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) estimated that we are emitting 360~Mt yr$^{-1}$ of methane, compared to biogenic emissions of around 200~Mt yr$^{-1}$ \citep{Atkinson2000}.
    In 1995 emissions of other VOCs were estimated at 1150\tgcpyr from biogenic sources, and 100\tgcpyr from anthropogenic sources \citep{Guenther1995, Atkinson2000}.
    The main non-methane BVOC emissions are isoprene (44\%) and monoterpenes (11\%) (\cite{Guenther2000, Kefauver2014}). 
    Land use changes can drastically affect isoprene sources, for instance in the tropics where large scale deforestation has converted forest into crop lands \citep{Kanakidou2005}.

    Biogenic VOC emissions affect surface pollution levels, potentially enhancing particulate matter (PM) and ozone levels.
    
    
    % Lead in to isoprene cascade
    Isoprene is emitted and enters the atmosphere in the gas phase, where it reacts with various chemicals, forming many new chemicals with reactions at various time scales.
    One common compound which is produced by these reactions is HCHO, which is easier to measure and often used to estimate how much isoprene is being emitted.
    The estimated yield of HCHO is but one aspect of the many processes going on in this space.
    There are many reactions which occur and are important to capture in models due to their impacts on air quality and physical properties in the lower atmosphere.
    The many children processes and products which begin with isoprene oxidation are often called the isoprene (photochemical) cascade \cite{Crounse2012,Paulot2012,Wolfe2016}.
    
  \subsection{The isoprene cascade}
    \label{LR:VOCs:IsopCascade}
    %TODO: Isoprene cascade reordering !
    % TODO: Find nice picture of isoprene products up to 2nd gen + yields if possible
    
    Isoprene forms many products with various lifetimes, here I will present an overview of some important mechanisms and products which are useful to my work.
    
    Photolysis and oxidation of many VOCs initially form alkyl radicals ($\dot{R}$).
    
    Alkenes (VOCs with double bonded carbon, such as isoprene) react with ozone leading to organic peroxy radicals (RO$\dot{O}$). 
    These go on to form many products and lead to (amongst other things) aerosol, formaldehyde, and ozone formation, depending on various other factors such as sunlight and NO pollution \citep{Atkinson2000}.
    
    \subsubsection{Oxidation}
    The primary first step for atmospheric isoprene is photooxidation, reacting with OH to form isoprene hydroxyperoxy radicals (ISOPOO, or ROO, or RO$\dot{O}$) (\cite{Wolfe2016,Marvin2017,Patchen2017}).
    There is still uncertainty about which pathways are most important following ISOPOO production: HO$_2$ reactions predominantly produce hydroxyhydroperoxides (ISOPOOH), NO reactions largely produce methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MCR), and RO$_2$ reactions are also possible \cite{Liu2016a}.
    
    
    The first step in oxidising alkenes (including isoprene) is a replacement by OH of a double bond, as summarised by the equation from \cite{Patchen2007}:
    % Uses package{mchem}
    \ce{R-CH=CH-R$^{\prime}$ + OH -> R-CH(OH)CH-R$^{\prime}$ }
    where R and R$^{\prime}$ represent hydrocarbons.
    This OH adduct then reacts with O$_2$ to produce a hydroxyperoxy radical (RO$\dot{O}$), which for isoprene can be any of six different isomers \citep{Patchen2007}.
    This is where the isoprene oxidation path splits depending on the NO$_X$ concentration.
    Reactions with NO can lead to ozone production in both isoprene and other non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) and NMVOCs (\cite{Patchen2007,AtkinsonArey2003}).
    These reactions are complex and coupled, for example NO$_2$ concentrations can be increased by NMOC and NO reactions \citep{AtkinsonArey2003}.
    
    
    %% NO2 reaction -> PAN
    Reaction with NO$_2$ forms hydroxynitrate (RONO$_2$), also known as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN).
    The first generation of organic nitrates produced by isoprene oxidation range from 7\% to 12\%, shown in laboratory experiments \citep{Paulot2009a, Mao2013},
    A portion of isoprene nitrates are recycled back to NO$_X$, so may serve as a reservoir of nitrogen and allow its transport to the boundary layer of remote regions (\cite{Patchen2007,Paulot2009a}).
    \cite{Patchen2007} examine this branching step where isoprene either forms ROO or RONO$_2$, and for specific conditions they determine the reaction rates for each branch.
    They find the most frequent pathway is the formation of ROO (99.3\%).
    Although the PAN formation branch is quite minor, it can be very important.
    PAN can transport NO$_X$ to otherwise clean regions (\cite{Horowitz1998}), and can build up in the winter \citep{Lelieveld2009}.
    PAN has a relatively long lifetime (against OH, order of 1 day) and is able to transport and release the NO$_X$ in environments which are quite far from any emissions.
    This transport can be exacerbated by fast winds and low OH concentrations, which makes PAN an important factor in modelling atmospheric chemistry.
    
    
    The oxidation products of isoprene through OH adduction (forming ISOPOO) followed by addition of O$_2$ produces various isomers of alkylperoxyl radicals (organic peroxyl radicals, or RO$_2$), which react with HO$_2$ or NO and produce stable products (often called oxidised VOCs or OVOCs) \citep{Nguyen2014}.
    The ISOPOO radicals are eventually destroyed by NO, HO$_2$ and other RO$_2$, with most pathways potentially producing HCHO \citep{Wolfe2016}.
    Oxidation reactions are important and quickly stabilise the ratio of NO to NO$_2$. 
    NO$_X$ is removed primarily by conversion to nitric acid (HNO$_3$) followed by wet or dry deposition \citep{Ayers2006}.
    There is still large uncertainty around the fate of various RO$_2$ radicals, which limits understanding of the relative importance of some chemical processes \citep{Crounse2013}.
    
    Some portion of emitted isoprene leads to SOA, potentially through the formation of methacrylic acid epoxide (MAE) formed by decomposition of methacryloylperoxynitrate (MPAN, a second generation product of isoprene oxidation) as shown in smog chambers and field studies in \cite{Lin2013}.
    In the presence of NO$_X$, the ISOPOO radicals (RO$\dot{O}$) form organic nitrates after reacting with NO.
    Any organic nitrates which are formed affect levels of both HO$_X$ (H, OH, peroxy radicals) and NO$_X$, acting as a sink (\cite{Mao2013} and references therein).
    
    
    %% LOW NOX scenario
    Isoprene oxidation by OH is less well understood when lower concentrations of NO are present in the atmosphere.
    Initially isoprene was thought to be a sink for atmospheric oxidants \citep[e.g.][]{Guenther2000}.
    It was thought that in low NO environments, like those far from anthropogenic pollution and fires, oxidation of isoprene would create ISOPOOH and lead to low concentrations of OH and HO$_2$ \cite{Paulot2009b}.
    In \cite{Paulot2009b}, the HO$_X$ levels are shown to be largely unaffected by isoprene concentrations.
    They show that ISOPOOH is formed in yields $> 70\%$, and MACR and MVK is formed with yields $< 30\%$.
    The formation of MACR and MVK produces some HO$_X$, although not enough to close the gap.
    \cite{Paulot2009b} goes on to suggest (and provide experimental evidence) that dihydroxyperoxides (IEPOX) are formed from oxidation of the ISOPOOH, which form precursors for SOAs as well as closing the HO$_X$ concentration gap.
    They then use GEOS-Chem, modified to include IEPOX formation, to estimate that one third of isoprene peroxy radicals react with HO$_2$, and two thirds react with NO. 
    They estimated $95 \pm 45$\tgpyr IEPOX being created in the atmosphere, which (at the time) was not modelled by CTMs.
    Their work showed another pathway for isoprene based SOA creation, through these IEPOX creation and HO$_X$ recycling mechanisms.
    \cite{Peeters2010} suggested that the work of \cite{Paulot2009b} only partially bridges the gap between clean air HO concentration measurements and models.
    They suggested four new mechanisms for OH recycling in these pristine conditions.
    These can be summarised as OH regenerating reactions which occur during photolysis of hydroperoxy-methyl-butenals (HPALDs), and resulting photolabile peroxy-acid-aldehydes (PACALDs).
    These reactions are highly non-linear and subject to large uncertainty, however when compared against several campaigns they were shown to improve one particular models (IMAGES) HO$_X$ concentrations.
    In \cite{Crounse2012}, MACR products are examined in various conditions and hydroxy recycling is also observed in low NO conditions.
    
    Although understanding of OH production/recycling in these low NO conditions has been improved, many observations of OH are still quite under-predicted in models \citep{Mao2012}.
    \cite{Mao2012} showed how traditional OH measurements may be overestimated due to VOC oxidation.
    They looked at measurements in a remote forest in California and found that the instruments were generating OH internally.
    \cite{Nguyen2014} also see this VOC oxidation interference in measurements using a gas chromatographer (GC) with an equipped flame ionisation detector (FID).
    This lends more credence to the current understanding of VOC oxidation as it closed the gap between measurements and model predictions (\cite{Mao2012}).
    
    \cite{Peeters2010} showed that HO$_2$ is produced at near unity yields following isoprene oxidation initiated by HO.
    TODO: read more Peeters2010
    
    \cite{Nguyen2014} examine various measurement techniques to determine isoprene reactions in non-laboratory conditions.
    Their work discussed how large uncertainties persist in isoprene oxidation, which carries through to predictions by atmospheric models.
    \cite{Nguyen2014} show preliminary estimates of low-NO yields of MVK and MCR to be 6$\pm3\%$ and 4$\pm2\%$ respectively, consistent with TODO:\cite{Liu2013}, but only when cold-trapping methods are employed.
    These yields each increase (due to interference by OVOCs) to greater than 40\% when directly sampled by GC-FID.
    
    % Night time stuff
    During the night isoprene is oxidised by NO$_3$ radicals, which joins to one of the double bonds and produces organic nitrates in high yield (65\% to 85\%) \citep{Mao2013}. (todo: read mao2013 para 3 cites)
    These organic nitrates go on to produce further SOAs, largely due to NO$_3$ reacting with first generation isoprene oxidation products \citep{Rollins2009}.
    \cite{Rollins2009} examine SOA production in a large chemical reaction chamber, over 16~hr in the dark and find first generation mass yield ($\Delta$SOA mass$/\Delta$isoprene mass) to be less than 0.7\%, with further oxidation of initial products (isoprene reacting twice with NO$_3$) yielding 14\%.
    This led to an overall mass yield of 2\% over the 16~hr experiment.
    
    Even with the recent boom in isoprene analysis, uncertainties remain in the isoprene oxidation mechanisms.
    Examples (taken from \cite{Nguyen2014}) include isoprene nitrate yields, which range from 4-15\% \citep{Paulot2009a}, 90\% disagreements in MAC and MVK yields TODO:\citep{Liu2013}, various possible sources for SOA TODO:\citep{Chan2010, Surratt2010, Lin2013}, unknown HPALD fates, incomplete O$_2$ incorporation TODO:\citep{Peeters2009,Crounse2013}, and under-characterized RO$_2$ lifetime impacts TODO:\citep{Wolfe2012}.

    \subsubsection{Ozononlysis}
    Ozononlysis is the splitting of carbon chains by ozone molecules, and is among the primary oxidation pathway for volatile alkenes \citep{Nguyen2016}.
    Criegee intermediates (carbonyl oxides with two charge centres) are formed when isoprene reacts with O$_3$. 
    \cite{Nguyen2016} examine in detail a few of these, with proposed mechanisms for C$_1$ and C$_4$ Criegee intermediate reactions.
    The C$_1$ stabilised Criegee (CH$_2$OO, $\sim 61\%$) is therein proposed to react with water yielding $73\%$ hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide (HMHP), $6\%$ HCHO $+$ H$_2$O$_2$, and formic acid $+$ H$_2$O, and the same products with yields of 40, 6, and 54$\%$ respectively when this Criegee reacts with (H$_2$O)$_2$.
    TODO: more on Nguyen2016?
    
    \subsubsection{SOA}
    \label{LR:VOCs:IsopCascade:SOA}
    %% SOA production and overview?
    Gas phase emissions with higher vapour pressures can be oxidised into lower vapour pressure products which will partition between gas and particle phase, often called semi or non-volatile. 
    The aerosol products from these gas phase emissions (or the children thereof) are called SOA \citep{Kanakidou2005}.
    In the \cite{Kanakidou2005} review of global SOA science, uncertainty in radiative forcing of aerosols is highlighted, and 20-90~\% of PM mass in the lower troposphere is OA.
    Less volatile OA also plays a role, although PM production from this source is complicated and makes up only a small fraction ($\sim 1 \%$) of the resulting PM (\cite{Kroll2008, Bei2012}).
    Modelling OA has many uncertainties due to the complexity of SOA formation and various pathways such as aqueous phase oxidation which can significantly contribute to concentrations.
    This is further hindered by poor understanding of precursor emissions, and lumping together various compounds, of which only some form SOA (for example ORVOCs in GEIA (back in 2005)).
    Satellite data requires SOA models to estimate a full vertical profile of aerosols for remote sensing techniques \citep{Kanakidou2005}.
    
    SOA formation from VOCs in atmospheric CTMs is generally imperfect due to the complicated chemistry and diverse nature of atmospheric conditions.
    Yields of SOA from VOCs are often lumped together and based on empirical laboratory chamber data. 
    VOC oxidation was not feasible $\sim 12$ years ago (2005), as chamber studies did not extend over a large enough parameter range and the importance of heterogeneous aerosol chemistry on SOA formation was unquantified \citep{Kanakidou2005}.
    
    One of the large uncertainties with OA is the total effect on radiative forcing, 12 years ago it was well understood that most OA cool the atmosphere, with smaller particles having a larger affect due to the size matching the wavelengths of visible light \citep{Kanakidou2005}. 
    Transport and indirect effects complicate matters further, with cloud creation and modification of cloud properties being quite difficult to accurately predict.
    In the third IPCC report \citep{IPCC2001}, the uncertainty involved if OA forcing was a factor of 3 times the estimated effect. 
    This has since been improved however OA and cloud formation still remains a large uncertainty in more recent IPCC reports \citep{IPCC_Chapter2}.
    Figure \ref{LR:fig:IPCC_RF_AR4} shows the radiative forcing (RF) of various atmospheric constituents, it's clear that OA uncertainty dominates.
    Figure \ref{LR:fig:IPCC_RF_AR5} shows the same summary updated in chapter 8 of the fifth report, where the SOA uncertainty remains quite large.
    It's currently understood that SOA plays an indirect and complex role in cloud properties, with a net cooling effect \citep[Chapter 7,8]{IPCC_AR5_WG1}

    (TODO: read more of Kanakidou2005)
    The emissions of precursors to SOA was and is quite uncertain, in \cite{Kanakidou2005} they state that these uncertainties range from a factor of 2 to 5.
    They highlight emissions and flux measurements as well as implementing satellite data in models as a means of improving the emissions inventories.
    In 2005, (as of \cite{Kanakidou2005},) the knowledge gaps in isoprene and terpene oxidation processes included precursor gases to SOA, impact of NO$_X$ on SOA formation, heterogeneous reactions between particles and gaseous compounds, aqueous phase chemistry, and complete aerosol compositions.
    At this time SOA driven nucleation was under debate, as chamber studies showed that SOA led to new particles but only in the particle free laboratory setting. 
    Nucleation of new particles was suppressed by condensation if any seed aerosol was already present.
    Observed nucleation outside of laboratories was suggested to have arisen from biogenic SOAs, driven by ozonolysis.
    \cite{Kanakidou2005} concluded that it is very likely that organics contribute to particle growth and formation rates.
    
    
    \subsubsection{Night time chemistry}
    At night when OH concentrations have dropped, isoprene can remain in the atmosphere to be transported. 
    Typically less than half of this night time isoprene is removed through ozonolysis \citep{AtkinsonArey2003}, however, in polluted areas where high levels of NO$_X$ exist, isoprene is consumed by a different radical.
    During the night time, nitrate radicals (NO$_3$) build up, especially in areas with high NO$_X$ levels.
    In areas with high NO$_X$ levels, greater than 20\% of the isoprene emitted late in the day ends up being oxidised by the NO$_3$ radical over night \citep{Brown2009}.
    So while night time isoprene is not as highly concentrated, is does have varying biogenic and anthropogenic sinks.
    At night isoprene has affects on both NO$_X$ concentrations and ozone levels, and can form harmful SOAs \citep{Brown2009, Mao2013}.
    The night-time  concentrations of OH and ozone also have a complex effect on NO$_X$ removal in high latitude winters, when photolysis and NO reactions are reduced \citep{Ayers2006}.
    
        
    % Lead in for HCHO section
    One of the major products of isoprene chemistry is HCHO.
    HCHO is important both for its own sake, and as a proxy for determination of isoprene emissions.
    
\section{HCHO}
\label{LR:HCHO}
  % What is HCHO:
  HCHO, aka methanal, methyl aldehyde, or methylene oxide, is of the aldehyde family.
  HCHO is an OVOC which is toxic, allergenic, and a potential carcinogen. 
  It is dangerous at low levels, with WHO guidelines for prolonged exposure at 80~ppb.
  HCHO is used as an adhesive in plywood, carpeting, and in the creation of paints and wallpapers.
  Emissions in enclosed spaces can build up to dangerous levels, especially if new furnishings are installed (\cite{Davenport2015}).
  At global scales HCHO in furniture is less important, as concentrations are driven by photochemical reactions with methane and other VOCs.
  
  %Sources
  
  \cite{Millet2008} show that anthropogenic emissions of HCHO in America are mostly negligible, although improved sensitivity from oversampling allowed satellite detection of enhanced HCHO concentrations over Houston and Texas \citep{Zhu2014}.
  This is not the case in China, since massive population centres and industrial districts are emitting huge amounts of VOCs into the atmosphere \citep{Fu2007}.
  \cite{Fu2007} use GOME measurements over Asia and derive biogenic, anthropogenic, and pyrogenic VOC emissions, and \cite{Zhu2014} use oversampling of the OMI HCHO measurements to determine anthropogenic highly-reactive VOC emissions.
  Then with their updated emissions they show how surface ozone is affected, with a seasonal increase of 5-20~ppb simulated by GEOS-Chem.
  
  %TODO How measured (in-situ, satellite)
  
  % Measurement difficulties
  In-situ measurements also contain errors, depending on the device used and chemical being measured this error can be significant.
  \cite{Dunne2017} analyse the uncertainty of VOC measurements (including isoprene) using three different techniques during a campaign in Sydney in 2012.
  The major sources of uncertainty in measurement techniques included interference from non-target compounds and under-reporting.
  Overall isoprene uncertainty in their measurements was a factor of 1.5 to 2.
  This can feed into uncertainties in modelling and satellite retrievals, as verification and correlations are affected.
  
  
  \subsection{Satellite measurements}
  \label{LR:HCHO:Sat}
  
    Satellite measurements can be performed using spectral fitting followed by conversion to vertical column densities.
    The use of multiple satellites can even be used to detect intradiel concentrations in trace gas columns, as shown in \cite{Stavrakou2015} using OMI and GOME-2 measurements, which have respective overpass times of 1330 and 0930 LT.
    These various measurements can be used to improve models, which allows prediction of harmful and costly events, and prevention of scenarios in which pollution events are likely.
    
    %Satellite Errors
    While satellite data is effective at covering huge areas (the entire earth) it only exists at a particular time of day, is subject to cloud cover, and generally does not have fine horizontal or vertical resolution.
    Concentrations retrieved by satellites have large uncertainties, which arise in the process of transforming spectra to total column measurements, as well as instrument degradation (satellite instruments are hard to tinker with once they are launched).
    Uncertainty in transforming satellite spectra comes from a range of things, including measurement difficulties introduced by clouds, and instrument sensitivity to particular aerosols \citep{Millet2006}.
    Many products require analysis of cloud and aerosol properties in order to estimate concentration or total column amounts \citep{Palmer2001,Palmer2003, Marais2012, Vasilkov2017}.
    
    There are two types of measurement error, arguably the worst of these is systematic error (or bias) which normally indicates a problem in calculation or instrumentation.
    If the systematic error is known, it can be corrected for by either offsetting data in the opposite direction, or else fixing the cause.
    A proper fix can only be performed if the sources of error are known and there is a way of correcting or bypassing it.
    Random error is the other type (often reported as some function of a datasets variance, or uncertainty), and this can be reduced through averaging either spatially or temporally. 
    By taking the average of several measurements, any random error can be reduced by a factor of one over the square root of the number of measurements.
    This is done frequently for satellite measurements of trace gases (which are often near to the detection limit over much of the globe).
    For example: \cite{Vigouroux2009} reduce the measurement uncertainty (in SCIAMACHY HCHO columns) by at least a factor of 4 through averaging daily over roughly 500km around Saint-Denis, and only using days with at least 20 good measurements.
    The main source of error in satellite retrievals of HCHO are due to instrument detection sensitivities, and the vertical multiplication factor (discussed in more detail in Section \ref{BioIsop:Uncertianty:Satellite}) \citep{Millet2006}.
    
    % Lead in to modelling
    In conjunction with atmospheric chemistry and radiative models, satellite measurements can be used to quantify the abundance of several chemical species in the atmosphere.
    Isoprene is hard to measure directly due to its short lifetime and weak spectral absorption, instead HCHO is often used as a proxy (\cite{Millet2006, Fu2007, Dufour2009, Marais2012, bauwens2013satellite, Kefauver2014, Bauwens2016}).
    This leads to a method of isoprene emissions estimation termed top-down (as opposed to bottom-up estimates like MEGAN).
    The existence of satellite data covering remote areas provides an opportunity to improve VOC emissions estimates leading to more robust models of global climate and chemistry. 
    Satellite data allows us to verify large scale models of natural emissions, and their subsequent chemistry.
  
\section{Modelling}
\label{LR:Models}
  
  
  \subsection{Emissions}
  
  %% HOW estimates are made
  There are two commonly used ways of estimating isoprene emissions, top-down or bottom-up.
  Bottom-up emission estimates generally model the flora and events which emit isoprene, like Eucalypts, factories, shrubs, etc.
  They use various properties of the emitters in order to estimate how much isoprene is being produced.
  Some of these properties include leaf areas, speciated responses to sunlight and temperature, moisture stress, etc (\cite{Guenther1995,Guenther2006}).
  Understanding how much isoprene is emitted, when and by what, is complicated.
  Since little data exists with which to verify many of these bottom-up emission inventories, they can be uncertain on a large scale.
  Emissions inventories such as MEGAN are bottom-up and use models of emissions based on tree types, weather, and other parameters.
  
  Top-down estimates look at how much of a chemical is in the atmosphere and try to work out how much of its major precursors were emitted.
  This generally takes advantage of longer lived products which may reach a measurable equilibrium in the atmosphere.
  For isoprene this is done by looking at atmospheric HCHO enhancement, which can be largely attributed to isoprene emissions once transport and other factors are accounted for.
  Recently \cite{Stavrakou2015} used satellite HCHO measurements to constrain anthropogenic sources of isoprene and found good global agreement with the bottom up estimates, although some regions had sources differ by up to 25-40\%. 
  Their study used the RETRO 2000 database for anthropogenic emission aprioris except for Asia in 2008 where REASv2 was used. 
  Since 1997, when GOME first measured HCHO over Asia \citep{Thomas1998}, satellites have been able to provide a total column measurement of HCHO, one of the primary products of isoprene.
  
  % Lead into chem
  Models of emissions are often used as drivers for atmospheric chemistry models, which examine what happens to the various compounds emitted once they are mixed into the air.
  
  \subsection{Chemistry}
  
  Many models lack in-situ measurements with which to verify their chemical mechanisms, leading to large discrepancies, as seen in \cite{Marvin2017a}.
  TODO: briefly talk about Marvin2017a takeaways.
  
  Box models are much smaller scale than global CTMs, examining one uniform environment with many parametrisations such as transport and emissions.
  Box models can be used to check chemical mechanisms in specific scenarios, such as high or low NO$_X$ environments.
  \cite{Marvin2017} use a box model matching conditions in southeast USA to evaluate isoprene mechanisms from several models.
  
  \subsection{Uncertainties?}
  \label{LR:Models:Uncertainties}
    
    % Uncertainties in estimates
    Isoprene emissions estimates are still fairly uncertain, as global measurements are difficult and regional emissions can be very different. 
    %In 2005, Dr. C. Wiedinmyer et al. reviewed emissions inventories and showed %TODO 
    The global uncertainty of isoprene emission was estimated to be a factor of 2 to 5 (250-750\tgpyr) \citep{Kanakidou2005}.
    Improvements over the years have been incremental, and generally localised to regions of particular interest for air quality such as China and the USA TODO: find recent uncertainty estimate improvements examples.
    The lack of accuracy in BVOC emissions estimates prevents accurate determinations of the sources and distribution of pollutants including ozone and organic aerosols.
    Most of the tropospheric SOA comes from biogenic precursors, the evidence for this has grown over the last two decades \citep{Guenther1995, Kanakidou2005,Guenther2012}.
    Accuracy in VOC measurements is important: it has been shown that even the diurnal pattern of isoprene emissions has an effect on modelling ground level ozone \citep{Hewitt2011, Fan2004}.
    
    It is important to note that many estimates of isoprene emission are based on a few algorithms which can depend greatly on input parameters (\cite{Arneth2008,Niinemets2010}).
    \cite{Arneth2008} argue that this monopoly of emissions estimates may be leading us to an incorrect understanding of isoprene chemistry.
    \cite{Yue2015} has shown that this is still a problem by looking at land carbon fluxes and modelling the sensitivity to VOC emissions estimates using two independent models of VOC emission.
    One model is photosynthesis based and estimates isoprene emissions using electron transfer energies and leaf physiology \citep{Niinemets1999}, while the other (MEGAN) uses the light and canopy temperature (\citep{Guenther1995,Arneth2007} TODO: Read Arneth et al., 2007; Unger et al., 2013).
    Both are sensitive to light and temperature parameterisations.
  
\section{Australia}
\label{LR:Aus}
  % Description of uniqueness
  In Australia most long term air quality or composition measurements are performed in or near large cities.
  Australia is dominated by areas with little anthropogenic influence and no ground based measurements of the natural emissions taking place \citep{VanDerA2008}.
  Due to the lack of in-situ ground based measurements, estimates of VOC emissions are uncertain, with large scale extrapolation required \cite{Millet2006}.
  Since many Australian cities are on the edge of regions with rich VOC emissions, it is very important to clarify the quantity, type, and cause of VOC emissions.
  Understanding of emissions from these areas is necessary to inform national policy on air pollution levels.
  
  %Transport stuff
  Biomass burning in southern Africa and South America has previously been shown to have a major influence on atmospheric composition in Australia \citep{Oltmans2001, Gloudemans2006, Edwards2006}, particularly from July to December \citep{Pak2003, Liu2016}.
  
  % More uniqueness
  \cite{Guenther2006} estimated that the Australian outback is among the worlds strongest isoprene emitters with forests in SE Australia having emission factors greater than 16 mg m$^{-2}$ h$^{-1}$ (see figure \ref{LR:Aus:fig_MEGAN_EF}).
  Measurement campaigns in SE Australia have since cast doubt on the emission factors used by MEGAN, as the Eucalyptus trees and soil moisture were poorly studied \cite{Emmerson2016}.
  These emissions factor estimates are not well verified and measurements of isoprene (or other BVOC) emissions barely cover Australia either spatially or temporally.
  However, comprehensive coverage of one high yield product (HCHO) in the atmosphere over Australia exists in the form of satellite measurements.
  
  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/MeganIsoprene1.png}
    \caption{ Part of a figure from \cite{Guenther2006} showing global isoprene emission factors. }
    \label{LR:Aus:fig_MEGAN_EF}
  \end{figure}
  
  % voc estimates
  \subsection{VOCs}
    Bottom up inventories of VOCs remain largely uncertain due to extensive extrapolation over plant functional types, changing land cover, and parameterised environmental stressors \citep{Guenther2000,Kanakidou2005,Millet2006}.
    VOC emission estimates are highly sensitive to many factors, several of which are not well characterised in Australia \citep{Sindelarova2014, Bauwens2016}.
    Changes in parameterisation of soil moisture in the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN, \cite{Guenther1995}) lead to massive changes in Australian isoprene emission estimates \citep{Sindelarova2014}.
    Over Australia MEGAN has problems involving unpublished plant functional types and their emissions, as well as poorly optimised soil moisture parameterisation \citep{Emmerson2016}.
    
    Australia has the potential to be a major hotspot of isoprene emissions according to \cite{Guenther2006,Guenther2012}, which shows heavy emissions factors in the region.
    Although recent work suggests that some Australian eucalypts may not be as egregious isoprene emitters as once thought \cite{Emmerson2016}.
    Emissions in MEGAN are based on plant functional types, which can vary heavily even within species.
    TODO: more on Muller2008
    Australia also lacks a clear estimate of emitted monoterpenes.
    \cite{Emmerson2016} suggest that monoterpenes may be emitted in similar quantites to isoprene, with more measurements required to determine if this is so.
    They compare emissions estimates from MEGAN against data from several field campaigns and see overestimated isoprene emissions, as well as underestimated monoterpene emissions.
    Their work suggests that MEGAN estimates of isoprene emissions may be 2-6 times too high, and monoterpene emissions $\sim3$ times too low over southeast Australia.
    
    
    This problem is even more pronounced in Australia due to poor characterisation, or because emission factors are based on northern hemispheric data.
    Many plant emissions rates have not been published, such as those for any Australian acacias.
    Additionally soil moisture is not well quantified which has a large effect on emissions.
    \cite{Muller2008} show how isoprene is poorly captured by the MEGAN model and analyse the affect of changing the soil moisture parameter, which can reduce the overall bias for Australia.
    
    Uncertainties in isoprene emissions could explain why models of HCHO over Australia are poor at reproducing satellite measurements \citep{Stavrakou2009}.
    
  \subsection{Air quality}
    % Air Quality metric example
    Australian air quality is monitored independently within each state, using various metrics. These metrics are measured by varying numbers of monitoring stations in each state.
    In New South Wales (NSW) the metrics used to determine air quality are: particulate matter (PM), O$_3$, CO, NO$_2$, SO$_2$, and visibility.
    PM is separated into size bins: with radius $< 2.5 $~$\mu$m and $<10$~$\mu$m being PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ respectively.
    An air quality index equal to the worst of these metrics is used for NSW as shown at \url{http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/aqms/aqitable.htm}.
    Similar methods are used in other states to get an idea of air quality.
    Measurement stations are generally located in population centres, and don't regularly measure precursor emissions. 
    This is an important omission as naturally emitted precursor gases often get transported into cities where they affect air quality.
  
    
  
  
  \subsection{Measurements}
    
    % TODO: Campaigns
    TODO: Brief overview of all the measurement campaigns, pointing to Modelling and Data chapter for more details.
    There are relatively few measurements of isoprene in the southern hemisphere, including MUMBA(TODO CITE), other campaigns?, and very recently that girl from Macquarie University with an instrument in the daintree rainforest(TODO CITE, DESCRIBE?).
    For details on the MUMBA campaign see Section \ref{Model:Datasets:MUMBA}.
    An airflight campaign (HIPPO) measuring isoprene was also performed in 2009-2011? TODO: ask Jenny re this one.
    
    A particulate and air quality measurement campaign took place in Sydney using PTR-MS and GC-FID, for details see Section \ref{Model:Datasets:SPS}.
  
  
\section{Aims}
\label{LR:Aims}
TODO: outline of aims here (FIND THESE THEY ARE SOMEWHERE)
  
  \textbf{One of the aims in this thesis is to use the available satellite measurements to improve the estimates of isoprene emissions in Australia.}
  Satellites which overpass daily record reflected solar (and emitted terrestrial) radiation, and give us measurements over all of Australia.
  Combining satellite data with model outcomes provides a platform for the understanding of natural processes which is especially useful over Australia.
  Due to the low availability of in-situ data over most of the Australian continent, a combination of the models with satellite can fill the gap of understanding of emissions from Australian landscapes.
  Improved emissions estimates will in turn improve the accuracy of CTMs, providing better predictions of atmospheric composition and its response to ongoing environmental change.
