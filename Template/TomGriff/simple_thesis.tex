%-------------- 
% The difference between \input and \include is thus: \include creates an aux file for the included file, \input does not. \include is good for large files, like a chapter, since LaTeX won't reread the file if no changes have been made. \input is better for small inputs like data tables, since it doesn't create an aux file for the inputted file, it is read each and every time LaTeX is run. Additionally you *CAN* nest \input commands. you *CANNOT* nest \include commands.
